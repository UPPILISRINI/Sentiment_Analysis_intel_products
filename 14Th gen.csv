United States,12-04-2024,"Great price, great performance, great product. It doesn't break the budget and pairs great with 30 series Nvidias and the 4060. The integrated graphics makes this processor great for a starter until you can get a dGPU",Amazing,Intel-core-i5-12000

United States,26-02-2022,"Upgraded a 2600K pc with this CPU, B660 board and 32GB of 3600mhz ram.  It feels incredibly snappy now.  With GPUs now costing your firstborn child, it's nice that this upgrade boosted an aging gtx970 FPS by 5-15%.  (@2560x1080)  Gaming is also much smoother as low-FPS spikes are effectively non-existent now.The included heatsink and fan is actually not as terrible as I was anticipating.  It doesn't get all that loud and it looks halfway decent.  It seems to keep the temps down to the mid 80s under stress testing (70 ambient) and mid 60s during actual gaming.  I will replace it eventually but I'm not that concerned as it works fine.  I did wipe off the pre-pasted thermal grease and added some MX-4 instead.The internal HD 730 is nice to have as a backup.  Anyone who doesn't need that should seek out the ""12400F"" model as it's the exact same chip with no internal GPU, and it should be $15-$25 cheaper.As of this posting, it's hard to beat the value of this CPU (12400F/12400) for gaming.",Solid bang for buck and with a decent cooler.,Intel-core-i5-12000

United States,10-05-2022,"The CPU is great, my only issue is that what I ordered was listed as ""New"" and received, what I assume is, an opened box i5. It looks unused, the pre-applied thermal pad on the fan was still there, untampered with and I didn't see any thermal paste residue on the CPU itself. I needed the CPU and it works so, I have no intention of returning it, but just wanted to make folks aware of my experience.The box was sticky, covered in what felt like if soda spewed on the box and someone left it to dry up. Corners of the box were scuffed up and bent, the product itself was undamaged though. New Intel CPU boxes have ""Intel Factory Sealed"" tape on the corner of the box, opposite the side with the barcodes and it was completely gone, but you can see a couple scuffs on the box where someone carefully removed it, but still scuffed up and dented that part of the box in the process.","CPU is great, only one issue.",Intel-core-i5-12000
United States,23-12-2021,"I have this cpu on a cheap $80 ASUS prime mobo with 16gb ram, and a gtx 1050ti. I get a decent frame rate on high settings in most games like war zone, pubg, insurgency sandstorm. I even edited a 5 min YouTube video and it handled it like a champ 2:38 for full render. If your looking for a budget cpu for gaming this will do the job nicely.My only con to this cpu is the heat sink. Yes it keeps cpu cool, but I have had a problem with the 4 retention pins came loose at one point and kinda sagged and flipped around on top of the cpu. So make sure you are correctly and fully connected to mobo before doing to much handling. Or just get an aftermarket cooler with a bracket and screws and discard the stock cooler. That being said I am still using the stock cooler.",Great budget gaming cpu.,Intel-core-i5-12000

United States,11-08-2022,"I purchased this processor and was happy with it until I stumbled upon a youtube video that proclaimed that most memory doesn't run at it's max speed. My DDR5 memory did just that - it ran at 4000 instead of it's 5200 (and it is certified to run on this processor). In my motherboard's BIOS, I adjusted the memory to run at 5200 with XMP-1 (an ASUS setting). It crashed a lot, so I tried their XMP-2 setting and everything froze up. Next thing I knew, nothing worked! I bought new memory, a new motherboard and eventually a new processor. When I found out this processor was the part that went bad (and it has a 3 year warranty), I submitted a ticket to Intel and they concluded that I ""overclocked"" the processor by pushing the memory to 5200 and they sent me to their webpage that specified this processor has a 4800 limit. Since then, I looked at every page before the one they sent me and none of them said anything about the 4800 memory speed limit.If setting memory speed a little over 4800 will fry your processor, shouldn't there be warnings everywhere and in every step of your tweaking? I now have a fried processor sitting on my desk and who is to blame? Is it me for trying to get the best performance out of my hardware and never seeing any warnings about this? Or maybe for Intel for their XMP standard that doesn't give you any warnings - especially since this is their standard that they created.I give this processor 2 stars - 5 for performance, but 0 for getting my fried processor and blaming me for ignorance of technicalities that are not upfront and lack of a warning system that they could have and should have implemented to prevent such catastrophes.",Do NOT run over 4800 DDR5! - Warranty will be voided!,Intel-core-i5-12000

United States,01-08-2022,This CPU is one of the most best for gaming. It has plenty of cores to handle gaming and to mutitask. I went with the 12600k over AMD's 5600X because the price was cheaper and this CPU is also faster in single threaded workloads. 6 performance cores plus 4 efficiency cores will be plenty for gaming and moderare workloads for years to come.

United States,12-11-2023,"Decided to finally upgrade from my 6 or 7 year old Asus X99 platform and 980ti sli (yes that old) to an Asus Tuf Z790/12600k/Tuf 4080 OC gamers edition. My old 5820k was creating a HUGE bottleneck issue for my GPU, which I installed about a month prior. What a difference I must say. Now that I'm finally out of the stone age, I'm in awe as to how much things have changed in the PC gaming world. This current build smokes everything I throw at it so far. Which admittedly has only been a few games and benchmarks. I paired the processor and GPU with water blocks from an AIO Corsair system for my CPU, and a separate Granzon custom loop for the GPU. All I can say is wow. Fast boot times, 150 plus fps in some games like The Division 2 with medium settings at 1440p. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this processor/Z790 motherboard/GPU combo. Are there better options for better performance or there? Absolutely. But for the money, I believe that the average gamer would be hard pressed to find any significant issues with that platform. I was skeptical at first, as this is the first I5 processor I ever purchased for a PC, but as I stated previously, I am quite satisfied with my decision to take a leap of faith.

United States,13-11-2021,"UserBenchmark favors intel for some reason.  They would have you believe the 12600k is around 20% better than the 5600x, but watch CPU reviews on Youtube and you'll see individual gaming benchmarks puts them at the same performance but with the 5600x using half the power consumption.  Additionally, the motherboards for the 12600k can cost over twice as much as that of the 5600x ones.It basically just makes more sense to go with the 5600x at the time of this review, because both CPUs are the same price of $300.  The 12600k is not a bad CPU, it's just that the 5600x is considerably more affordable and efficient for the same performance as the 12600k.",Don't trust UserBenchmark,Intel-core-i5-12000

United States,19-09-2022,"Lovely cooler, looks efficient. It should have a backplate in the box for it. Unfortunately, it shipped without a backplate, and dealing with Intel support, they had me recount the same problem three times three different ways before telling me they were going to contact *management* to see *if* they could replace it, and told me I should consider RMA'ing it back through Amazon.  What the heck?  In other words, if I don't get an email by tomorrow afternoon from a call center manager I'm supposed to return the whole thing to Amazon and buy a different processor.  That's nuts!Update from customer service: The supervisor of the first two people called me back from a number that registered as a potential spam caller.  He said they don't send the backplate to their own cooler, except sometimes, it seems to be dependent on what box you have.  They operate on the expectation the mobo manufacturer sent the backplate.  However, he was sending it to *his* boss to see if they could send me the backplate to one of their own coolers.It was like talking to a Best Buy rep that's been instructed to sound knowledgeable when they aren't.Thankfully, it's only an 8$ part, but I certainly didn't give that money to Intel, and I'll be watching for higher performing AMD products in the future.","Check for all the parts, as mine had some missing",Intel-core-i5-12000

United States,23-01-2022,"No support for deepcool heatsinks, wasted time modifying it to fit, (it does work, but wasted a couple hours on a process that should take 5-10 minutes). I have never had so much trouble get a cpu to run in linux. Good grief, I’m a computer expert by trade, and intel should have waited to release this series. I know the competition is tough, but I definitely wont go and buy another one of these. I thought it would be a good investment. I may have damage my motherboard on install, as the cpu slip out of my hands and banged up against the socket bent some pins. It was so hard to get running under linux, graphics support is nonexistent, i can only the XE2 new graphics cards will be more of the same since these are based on that Technology. You can find a work around on Phoronix for the graphics problem, however the image on linux sucks it’s more pixelated than i would like. I would like to mention I needed to my rx 580 to get this thing running as the Linux OS didn’t recognize the GFX chip on the cpu. And with the way the situation is with gpu’s I’m lucky to have had one at hand. The Bios also doesn’t show on my pc correctly if you use the onboard Intel graphics, its cutoff . Also the hard drive was not recognized with the motherboard but it happed two motherboard asrock and gigabyte. I had to install a new elilo version to get the efi to work. What can i say the performance is good, but runs hot 120 watts at the cpu when doing multithreaded task like compiling the kernel. It does that fast but Ryzen 12 core does it faster and with less power 95watts. It’s hard to say this was an upgrade, my head hurts whenever an issue comes up with this cpu. Now after about month of use the gfx is acting weird, it starts to fragment / pixelated and gets stuck. I’m sure intel knows and I probably should have just gotten a kf series instead because it is so bad now i just left the dang rx 580 in the system. Maybe I’m not the only one, I’m sure a class action lawsuit is in the works. I have not been able to enjoy this since I purchased on day one. I would have returned this but then I would have to return the motherboard to another vendor and i sure don’t want to go to that trouble. I fortunately got ddr4 version so I reduced the amount of ram in the computer and will use it as is until it dies. Hopefully after this crypto boom I’ll be able to snag a ryzen 5th gen combo for cheap. My intel can fix this but it will be years before this happens. They are too busy playing catch up. The power efficiency is terrible and the whole experience is about as bad as it gets. Save yourself a headache and get something comparable like a 3700x or better. This is not worth the price or painful install procedures. I just thought it was ridiculous coming from intel, didnt they create the PCs we know of today??? Did i mention the bios was cuttoff on left and right edges so you cant read the functions??? I’m surprised Intel engineers released this, more of a sample than a final product. Buy something else, did i mention the cheapest motherboard sets you back around $200, so $500 into this ordeal is not a good experience, could have purchased 2 sets of used ryzen 7 8 core cpus and motherboard for the same money and ultimately gotten more performance in power usage and cpu. That’s my thoughts on this product.",Pain in to setup. Nothing but a headache. I wish I would have got a different cpu.,Intel-core-i5-12000

Superb service, thank you!The item; brand new and sealed as you expect to see if you purchased from a physical store. Simple and easy to install the chip which was automatically detected by the PC and the improvement was immediately noticeable.The cooling assembly looks the part with a larger heat sink area compared to the old CPU but sadly the mount was incompatible with my motherboard so I had to revert to using the old heat sink. Seems to be fine so far but I’ll keep an eye on it. The reason for the incompatibility is my original mounting is achieved using 4 spring-mounted Philips screws but the new cooler is supplied with plastic press studs that were too wide to insert into the threaded holes.The new cooler comes with the thermal paste pre-applied so simply a case of scraping it off with a knife and spreading it onto the old heat sink.

Then, prices decided to jump ship and they almost doubled in price while halving in stock.Thankfully, Intel seems relatively unaffected by the craze. For $155, the 10400 offers incredible performance for the price. Intel decides to lock overclocking and ram speeds with this chip, which is decidedly pretty stupid, but it still works.This could honestly be paired with up to a 3080 without much of a bottleneck (though it really shouldn't).

United States,07-07-2022,"I recently built an 15 12600k system and it has plenty of ups and downs. I don't see any of the downs being the fault of the chip or Intel. Most of the issues I have experienced with the new system (and there have been many), have to do with the motherboard or ddr5. I upgraded from a i7 4770k I had on a 24/7 4.8ghz overclock for 7 years. The new I5 is CLEARLY faster in both single and multi threaded performance. Like many I experience many errors in the windows 11 event viewer usually something to do with an efficiency core. At the end of the day I don't see any real world effects on performance, and even microsoft says to ignore these errors.I have traditionally chosen intel because of their on board graphics support. I've had a graphics card go out in the past and having on board video allows you to at least use your system as a system while you figure out what has happened.

I was nervous at first, because my plan was to build a low-ish power, 100% passively-cooled, internal GPU, no moving parts PC for use in my bedroom, where my previous computers were annoyingly loud. I used a Noctua NH-P1 passive cooler and a Seasonic PX-500 fanless PSU, and my system is not only 100% silent, it turns in impressive benchmark numbers and never gets close to throttling temperatures even after sustained Cinebench runs.I run my system at -130 mV, with no overclocking, and CPU power consumption peaks at about 100 W, while idle CPU power consumption is less than 2W. My heatsink never gets too hot to touch with my bare hand in daily use. The only thing preventing my system from being a high performance gaming PC is the lack of dedicated GPU, but the internal GPU is more than enough for me to run four simultaneous instances of BlueStacks 5 to play my favorite mobile game, and fast enough to run Diablo III and EVE Online with medium settings.The Core i5-12600K is roughly competitive in performance and price with the AMD Ryzen 7 5700X.",The best value CPU of this generation,Intel-core-i5-12000

I seem to have very good frame rate stability & seems to be able to handle most games even without a GPU. If a game used to be on console it'll likely work with this CPU & perform better than gaming console CPUs. I used to use a basic mini PC with an older i7 6700T but with this in my gaming PC is have next to no issue running HD graphics in games like GTA 5. And its amazing for the price. Was going to go with an i7 13700K this ended up costing half the price of the i7 & an i7 may be a bit overkill for most of the games I plan on playing on my PC anyway. Only downside is the newer Intel graphics settings apps suck.,Amazing CPU for the money!,Intel-core-i5-12000

Ich habe mir eine Kombination aus Intel 9400F und MSI Z370 Mainboard und 16 GB Crucial Ballistix bestellt.

Ich hatte den Computer zur Analyse in einer Werkstatt abgegeben mit Vermutung auf defekt der Grafikkarte.Da der Computer dann später anfing ständig selbständig neuzustarten habe ich ein neues Mainboard bestellt bei Amazon. Ein ASRock Phantom Gaming SLI Z390. Das löste das Problem mit dem ständigen Neustarten.Leider stürzten Spiele und gelegentlich Programme immernoch ab. Ein Tausch der Grafikkarte gegen meine alte GTX 1070 löste das Problem leider auch nicht.Ich war aber auf den Computer angewiesen und nutze ihn erst einmal noch weiter.Ich entschied ich mich leider erst spät die Teile zu reklamieren.Es waren schon 23 Monate vergangen aber es war noch vor Ende der Garantiezeit.

United States,23-03-2024,Instalación,Bueno al momento de instalar si tenía un poco de miedo pero bueno todo salió bien hay que seguir probándolo para ver qué tal va,Intel-core-i9-12000
United States,18-07-2023,"Works great so far, maybe pre owned??","Came packaged kinda poorly, and didn’t include the golden coin case, which makes me think maybe it was pre owned. When I opened the packaging though it had no paste on it and the pins looked brand new, so maybe they just don’t include it anymore since it isn’t the newest flag ship??",Intel-core-i9-12000
United States,23-08-2022,So many cores to use!,"I bought this instead of the 12th gen i7 anticipating future demand for more cores. There is a price difference to consider. As many know, more cores doesn't necessarily mean better. Games only use a max of 6 cores, though it may vary from game to game. If you just want to game, buy the i7 series. My 4790k had served me so well, it's still my backup on my old mobo. It's been at least 5 years since I bought ol' reliable. She's been through rough seas. It was time for her to rest easy.For the i9, in terms of gaming performance, only CPU heavy games like RTS games will see any benefit. Multi-tasking also sees benefit, though that's limited to the hard drive it's working off of. Still, I expect great things in the far future.The packaging is a keeper to be sure, too.",Intel-core-i9-12000
United States,21-07-2022,Not worth it over the 12700k IMHO,"The 12900k can be hard to justify. The 12700k is around two-thirds the cost and the difference in performance is only a few percent. Furthermore, you can get away with a moderate cooling solution on the 12700k whereas the 12900k really requires a top of the line cooler which will set you back even more. Even while using the NH-D15 CPU cooler I decided to underclock the 12900k a little bit in order to keep thermals in check, bringing the performance nearer to the 12700k. Given the option to do it over, I would have just gone with a 12700k and saved myself about $250.",Intel-core-i9-12000
United States,02-05-2022,Just about the best gaming chip you don't need!,"Aside from the nightmare Alder Lake is with ram clocking, this thing does everything you need to. Consistently hits 5.1 - 5.2ghz when needed.Don't listen to the AMD fanboys who try to slander this chip for its heating. I literally just have a 240mm AIO and it doesn't go above 78° and when gaming never even touches 70°. Just do 5 seconds of research on a half decent air cooler or AIO and you're fine with temps",Intel-core-i9-12000

United States,11-12-2023,"Techno is great, but to expensive","Technology is one of the best things they have invented, this product is good, it works in the right way, it gives me the graphic image and everything that comes with it has its limitations, compared to others that give more power, more quality and more fps, like everything in life I don't know if I would buy it again, but the price is very high the price should be more considered in the price, I hope they improve their prices",Intel-core-i9-12000
United States,24-12-2023,"Seems like a great chip, but runs hot.","I'm using Thermal Grizzly's contact frame to help and an Arctic AIO, so I'm keeping this beast chilled as much as I reasonably can.  I'm not overclocking; that's just not the point of this system.  It crushes my i7 6700K-which i should hope that it does given six generations of chip architecture.  I'm looking forward to pushing this to see what it can really do, but so far, Cyberpunk 2077 and PoE play great.Beyond that, we'll wait and see.  I just got the machine put back together yesterday after having to hit Best Buy for DDR5 since the sticks I got from Amazon were DoA.",Intel-core-i9-12000
United States,31-05-2022,"Its the best, so its pricy.","It's a good CPU, able to game and do the productive stuff. I paired it with DDR5. People say it gets hot but I haven't found that even though I'm only using a Noctua air cooler. Those little E cores actually do some work, and of course the P cores are fast. It's funny that the E cores are considered ""efficiency cores"" because they do use a lot of power.I think most consumers should get a 12700k or 12600k rather than this since they'll do just as well in games and since you can upgrade in less than a year. If you are running an app that uses all 16 cores, like a minecraft editor, then you may want to go for this 12900k, especially if you can find a sale.I've been playing Flight Sim 2020, Cyberpunk, Dota and Minecraft Java quite a bit with this and the only place it's weak is flightsim. That's not really the CPU's fault though because Flightsim is a very poorly written game which bottlenecks on the main thread. It's actually an argument for the KS version of this CPU. But alas, even I have limits.",Intel-core-i9-12000
United States,26-08-2022,some serious power. Gets very hot.,"If you've seen anything about it, you'll know this bad boy loves to get fired up. Typically running cpu intense games at max graphics brought this chip up to 100°C! That's tjmax! Ouch! I have a kraken x52 strapped to it as well and still needed to undervolt, which is probably saving her life. Once you do though, And properly, there's honestly no performance drop. It's definately too good of a cpu for what I use it for, I just like to say I have it. Definitely water cool this thingz unless you know what you're doing. Also, you might want to get one of those thermal grizzly mounts for it. Do it right the first time you mount it, and don't let it bend under those extreme temperatures.  All in all, the cpu is extremely powerful! But it's a bit on the expensive side. Though, What do you expect. It's a flagship chip.",Intel-core-i9-12000
United States,07-10-2022,Thermal issues,Obviously a fast and capable chip but this chip must be installed with a thermal contact frame . The chip warps at high temps causing loss of contact with the cooler. This leads to random reboots and/or shutdowns. Thermal contact frame will prevent this issue .,Intel-core-i9-12000

United States,16-12-2021,Unit was previously opened....,"I've put together a few systems and run some retail 12900k chips so far and the 12900k is by far an amazingly fast CPU.Unfortunately this one I ordered from Amazon came already opened. As soon as I opened the shipping box I could tell it had been opened before. The edge was uneven and the label crease was loose. I put my X-acto Knife down (which is what you need or something similar to open these as the label is there for a reason) and with just the gentlest of pressure the label peeled away from the center where someone oh so nicely had finely cut the label horizontal to make it easy to fold one side back over the other and with just a quick once over it looked almost normal.If I hadn't opened a few of them already with Intel's fancy new packaging I probably would not have noticed but the way the packaging normally is, it is VERY precise, tight, even lines and you will not be easily or gently opening it up with a simple light finger pry.My biggest fear was there wasn't going to be a CPU in there at all but luckily the right CPU was in there that matched the container batch but if something is sold as new I don't do open boxes.Make sure to check your packages before opening. The seal should be nice and tight and straight. The edges of the back flap should be firm and secure against the other flap and the bottom line/edges should be even and exacting.Give a gentle pull on each corner of the box where the label keeps it sealed to make sure it hasn't been altered or tampered with. It should be VERY firm and unable to just pull open easily. Look at the condition of the box itself around that area and even the gold disk inside.Fresh, brand new i9 12900k's are very pristine and boxed with precision.Still, they are fantastic processors overall and a worthy upgrade from 10th and 11th gen.",Intel-core-i9-12000

United States,22-06-2023,Didn't Buy this for Gaming.. It Sucked at Plex,"I was CONVIENCED that Intel's P+E Cores would be amazing for Plex as the four efficiency cores can run basic task and local streaming for Plex and reserving the eight performance cores for heavy transcoding. FROM MY EXPERIENCE IN MAY 2023, I can't tell if it's the motherboard firmware, Windows 10/11 scheduler (I did try both OSs), Intel's drivers, or even Plex not updated yet - what/whoever fault it is doesn't matter. I kept seeing my system crash constantly, the E CORES being used for EVERYTHING Plex needs (including transcoding) and overall, I am not convinced Intel's P+E Cores aren't ready for prime time.I ended up refunding this processor in order to get an Intel Core i9-10900K for the extra cores. I WOULD'VE gone with AMD if it wasn't for ensuring the best compatibility with Intel ARC because I want AV1 encoding capabilities.

Gaming is pointless on this cpu and it's just a fact. In 1440p and 4k u gain absolutely nothing over my old 10700k. Except for horrible Temps. This will average Temps at least 10c higher then previous Intel or my ryzen 5900x. And worst part is Intels unnecessary change in cpu cooler layout. U will spend weeks finding a cooler or trying to get manufacturer to send u a bracket to update existing cooler. Literally had to return my first one I purchased from best buy because I couldn't even find a cooler within the 15 day return policy and didn't want stuck with a DOA product. And the fact AMD is already releasing ryzen 3d which surpasses this by 20% it makes this jump to Intel again pointless. Because we all know Intel will change socket and layout again leaving us stranded again with no cooling options. Worse part. Not even a cooler in box to test cpu with.

United States,06-05-2024,Overkill for me and Most.,"This started a new PC build for me when it was on sale for $320. I haven't built a PC since 2007, so it has changed a bit since then. This thing runs hot at full load. Watch gamers nexus on YouTube. It will pull a solid 250+ watts running cinebench. I'm using an Arctic Freezer 2 420mm with a thermal grizzly contact frame and kryonaut, and it will load up to 80 degrees almost instantly without throttling but drop immediately to 25-30 degrees when the load stops. This is with ambient at 22 degrees.This thing is brutally fast, though, and in reality, outside of load testing it, I have rarely seen it go over 30% usage. The more recent i5 and i7 processors can more or less be equal in most use cases.  i5 13/14600, i7 13/14700.This processor is still top-tier and will be for a few years to come. 12th gen i-series processors were a game-changer, the 13th-gen improved on them a bit with more e-cores, and the 14th-gen is looking like a stop-gap to the next big thing.You won't be disappointed; make sure to keep it cool.",Intel-core-i9-12000

United States,22-05-2022,Cooking with fire...,"I came from an AMD 2990WX build that while it was good and stable, always had some quirks about it that just annoyed the crap out of me at best. While this probably can't multithread to the same degree, it does represent a lot of power and speed. 5.2GHz across 8 cores / 16 threads, on an air cooler and I'm not touching anything for OC...it's great as it is. Even the 'slow' cores clock in upwards of 4GHz, which the TR tapped out at best with 4.2 and that was only for a couple cores-worth.This one on air, does back off that max clock not soon afterwards; but I also have this in a 4u rack mounted case, with 4 chassis fans; vs the previous build which was on a 360 radiator/AIO, and had 13 system fans; but I was going for a rather ridiculous build with that vs this build I'm going for subtle/sleeper.That this system runs as fast as it does, with as little fan noise, on air...is something rather amazing.",Intel-core-i9-12000

United States,10-12-2022,The Supercharged Version,"The various letters at the end of the Intel processor can indicate several things ""K' processors are unlocked and can be overclocked. And there are 12-14 versions indicating their use or level of processing. This is a ""KS"" which is unlocked and what they call a ""special edition"". Each processor Intel produces is tested before shipment and when its abilities are tested as above average it is given the ""S"" designation. This means it has that little extra ability to process. The processors that test lower may be used for other applications and/or the graphics ability is turned off. Anyway, the ""KS' can be thought of as the best processor, especially for gaming and it normally will cost a little more than the other varieties",Intel-core-i9-12000
United States,25-02-2022,The best CPU I've owned so far. Rivaling even the 5900X! Intel is killing the game as of now.,"I upgraded to this CPU after some HEAVY research, asking Reddit (Both Intel and AMD subreddits), weighing in money VS performance gained. I have used AMD since I was a teen and started building computers. The conclusion is this: It is an amazing CPU, runs faster and cooler than my Ryzen 7 1700. The price AND performance VS AMD (Also including a board) was better than if I had went with a Ryzen 7 5800X.Some background information: I wanted to upgrade after receiving an Amazon gift card (I have never ordered computer parts from Amazon though). I upgraded from a Ryzen 7 1700, with an ASUS x370-f board. I really wanted to upgrade, and was sad also that Windows 11 did not support my CPU! I will give it to Microsoft for this, as it made A LOT of people upgrade their entire computers, all for basically the same OS as of now with newer looks, and not much done under the hood (EXCEPT for 12th gen Intel, so good news there too). Sadly, my old board STILL doesn't support the Ryzen 7 5000 series, and only the 3000 series (They are working on a BIOS apparently for the 5000 series, because of people who were in my shoes). I first almost ordered the Ryzen 7 3800XT, for $400! After a couple hours of research, asking, and thinking about it... I cancelled that order (Thankfully) and thought ""Well, if I am going to spend this much on upgrading my CPU, I might as well go all in/spend a little more for something better, as this may be my last big upgrade in this regard for awhile."" I was then going to get the Ryzen 7 5800X with an Asus board. There lied a problem of price, I could not find a board AND get that CPU still within my budget (At-least not a board that wasn't worse than the one I had in ways). I mentioned I had posted on the AMD subreddit, and even they suggested I go Intel (Intel is just killing it as of now, hands down, although I am sure AMD will retaliate). I ended up getting the MSI Z690-A DDR4 (I wish I had the money for DDR5 RAM, I would have went with the DDR5 version as it was basically the same price). I had A LOT of second thoughts on this board though, as it just didn't seem ""Premium"" as the one I had (I am going to do a whole review on it after this. I'll save my Pros & Cons for there.) This CPU also auto-clocks itself up or down depending on the load (Saw it clock down to 1GHz, although not for long, for example if not much processing power is warranted, which makes sense and I wish everything did). So if idling, it will clock down and save power/heat/and therefore longevity is increased. I absolutely love this CPU coming from AMD. Anyways...If you have a Corsair H100I RGB Platinum or similar cooler already: The included 1200 screws work just fine with the 1700 socket and this CPU, even though you are supposed to get the 1700 kit/screws for this CPU (Which I did, but they are taking FOREVER to ship, so I googled, and someone said using the 1200 screws will work just fine). I get better temps. than my Ryzen 7 1700. I can even overclock EVEN MORE but have no need, and no point.TL:DRUpgraded from: Ryzen 7 1700, Asus Rog Strix x370-f gaming.Upgraded to: i7-12700K, MSI Z690-A DDR4.Parts kept: 4x8GB 32GB DDR4 CL16 3000MHz RAM (With XMP, D.O.C.P), RTX 2070. The RAM works great with this CPU as well, although it TECHNICALLY (Latency wise, runs at 2T on Intel instead of 1T on AMD) runs slower than when on AMD (AMD's infinity fabric) but obviously whatever Intel is doing makes up for that, and therefore my RAM either runs faster/the same)Pros: It is an amazing CPU for price VS performance. The i5-12600K is good as well (I almost just went with it), and you would be fine going with it for gaming (As even it still has more cores technically than the Ryzen 7 5800X, it also beats the 5800X even though THIS CPU is supposed to be its comparison rival brother.) This CPU has cool temps on my Corsair H100I RGB Platinum cooler, and the P&E core structure are REALLY cool and fun to watch when doing tasks/gaming. It shipped fast!Cons: Literally none with the CPU itself. Just with shipping - It shipped really fast! Was here in 2-3 days after purchasing on here. The biggest complaint I have is Amazon's shipping (SO BE AWARE OF THIS) I have never ordered computer parts from Amazon, and have always used New-egg. They just left the CPU in my mail-box, and if it weren't for me looking at my camera's, and looking out for this part, it would have sat in the mail-box all day. My mail-box sadly is not very weather proof as well, and if it had been raining... It wouldn't have been good. Although it did come in a big box around it. The CPU also was jarred loose and flopping around in the box (Not held into the front window).I hope this review helps people!",Intel-core-i7-12000

I overclocked this via the motherboard/bios settings and it stays cool with a $30 fan cooler. (don't get a super cheap or small cpu cooler otherwise would risk overheating) Just follow installation instructions carefully the chip is delicate. windows experience rating is a 9.7 so that says it all.

United States,22-06-2023,Buyer’s Remorse,"If you buy a 12th or 13th gen Intel CPU, understand that you’re buying a chip that has a serious design flaw. The LGA 1700 contact pressure is nothing to overlook, and I wish I had of known about it before my purchase. It puts so much pressure on the chip that it flexes it to the point that you’ll have serious thermal performance issues. I’m talking 100c+ temps under load. There is a fix though: uninstall the cpu bracket on your motherboard, purchase an aftermarket CPU contact frame and install it. No more temp issues. Buying a high end chip and having to alter my motherboard with an aftermarket product just doesn’t sit well with me. Stay away from 12th and 13th gen Intel CPUs, or buy a contact frame with it.",Intel-core-i9-12000
United States,26-12-2021,Fantastic CPU,"Overkill for gaming but who only uses their computer for gaming? Really fast especially if you're using a decent mb and ram.E-cores are kinda useless though hopefully they'll be better used over time. Some games see better frame rates with them disabled while others see better.... It's either an optimization issue or e-cores aren't as effective as they are marketed. Still, the chip is fast.The only issue that I can see is the use of drm-like nonsense which has been talked about at length at tech places. Apparently some people have had issues with some games/programs because of it. DRM is a curse as it only makes things annoying/difficult for those who buy things because those using pirated offerings always break DRM.I'm knocking the the rating down because of the DRM-like nonsense on the chip.",Intel-core-i9-12000
United States,04-05-2022,Overheats easily,I installed a large air cooler with 3 fans in large desktop with 5 fans and good airflow. but it is not enough for the recently released i912900KF.  it still overheats and reaches 90c-96c degrees within 7-10 minutes of rendering when its 90% workload.I used premium thermal paste too. it still over heats.,Intel-core-i9-12000
United States,28-04-2023,"The processor also runs surprisingly cool, even under heavy load.","I recently got my hands on the Intel Core i9-12900K Desktop Processor, and I have to say, I am blown away by its performance. This processor is an absolute powerhouse, with 16 cores (8P+8E) and speeds of up to 5.2 GHz. It's also unlocked, which means I can push its limits even further if I want to.Installing the processor was easy enough, although I did have to make sure my motherboard was compatible with the LGA1700 socket and 600 series chipset. Once I had everything set up, I fired up my favorite games and applications to see how the processor would perform.The results were nothing short of impressive. The i9-12900K chewed through every task I threw at it with ease, from demanding video editing software to the latest AAA games. I was able to multitask without any lag or slowdowns, and my system felt incredibly responsive and snappy.The processor also runs surprisingly cool, even under heavy load. I did notice a slight increase in power consumption compared to my old processor, but it's a small price to pay for the sheer performance boost.Overall, I am extremely satisfied with the Intel Core i9-12900K Desktop Processor. If you're a power user or a gamer who demands the best performance, this processor is definitely worth considering. It's not cheap, but in my opinion, it's worth every penny for the sheer power and speed it delivers.",Intel-core-i9-12000
United States,27-04-2022,Insanely Powerful at The Cost of High Thermal/Power,"My primary use case for the 12900k is gaming and encoding video. Personally I could justify the higher price tag over the competing i5 and i7 because of my specific use case.Good Things:The processor is absolutely and insanely powerful. I am encoding 1080, 30fps video roughly 50% to 80% faster give or take than my previous processor which was a 11700kf! One single generation and an i9 upgrade has saved me astronomical amounts of time. As far as gaming goes… I would say is more heavily reliant on a graphics card so I won’t go into much detail on that. Overall this processor is wonderful and deserves its 5 stars.Not so good things:I didn’t take a star off for this because it isn’t really a problem rather just the way the processor is designed.It uses a metric ton of power, I’m talking 241 watts during my normal video encoding sessions. Which in turn generates a space heater worth of heat. One of those things “great power comes great responsibility”. I am telling you this because you NEED TO HAVE AN INCREDIBLE COOLER. I am currently using a Noctua NH-D15 and it’s okay. I would recommend it to anyone that prefers air cooling but nothing less. If you choose a cooler that is less you will regret it. I would venture to say you need the cooler I have mentioned or 280mm and above AIO to even keep it from thermal throttling at heavy load. Do not underestimates this, gaming it is much more tame, still running high temperatures but better. I still would get a really great CPU Cooler or otherwise you WILL be thermal throttling like crazy.Overall this is a great CPU and although not worth it for some, can be a great processor if it is worth it. Just beware of the watts and heat. I was dumbfounded.",Intel-core-i9-12000
United States,11-05-2023,Not necessary for everyone,"This isn't the processor for everyone, but it is very fast. The individual cores aren't significantly different from those in the 13th generation i7. But if you have a need for a lot of parallel processing then this may be the processor for you. I do software development, which it doesn't help 99% of the time, gaming, which it helps a little, and occasionally transcoding large amounts of video and music. During transcoding it helps a huge amount. I have over 300GB of FLAC audio files that I ripped from my CD collection, I never buy mp3s. I wanted to have that on my phone, but I didn't want to carry it at full rate because I can't tell the difference in the car, so I transcoded it. I had done that once before and it took more than a day on a five year old Ryzen 7. This machine took around 30 minutes. 30-40 times faster. At work the optics team, which uses ray tracing software to design optical telescopes and laser focusing lenses, uses i9s in preference to Xeons. The Xeons might be faster under some circumstances, but the machines are hugely expensive, so the i9s are much better for price performance. Would I buy it again? I'd probably buy the 13th generation, but if I had any sense I'd just get the 13th gen i7.",Intel-core-i9-12000

United States,22-11-2023,i9-12900K an excellent buy it！！,"Had a 11900K prior to this one, and as fast as it was even being overclocked to 5.3 ghz - the 12900K is just simply better. Put a minor overclock to 5.2 ghz and it's been so nice. P cores are freed up to do what they're supposed to do. E cores do the chores! Was hot at first before undervolting, but now that's done and temps are high 70s with a 360 mm Corsair AIO. Paired up with a Z690 from MSI and a RTX 3090 it's just the perfect combo. 12900K is completely free to do the data processing for the game, and 3090 handles the graphics side in all my triple A titles without needing to borrow from the system memory at all - needing to pull data through the processor. Resizable bar enabled and it's been awesome. Was worth every penny.",Intel-core-i9-12000
United States,02-01-2023,Great Upgrade from 9900K,"So far this thing is great! I upgraded from the 9900K and this has been a noticeable difference. I'm still in the process of updating drivers and reinstalling some software. I haven't done any overclocking so the Cinebench score and temps are straight stock settings.After seeing all the info on how hot this thing can get I added the Thermalright contact frame. It was a breeze to install. I watched the Gamer's Nexus video about this frame and followed their directions.For the motherboard I went with a MSI Z690 MPG Edge Wifi DDR4 so I could reuse my current RAM. I had to order a LGA 1700 bracket for the NZXT Kraken X73 AIO. I ordered both the frame and the LGA 1700 mount from Amazon and both arrived fast and were exactly what I needed.So far my temps are staying in the general range of my 9900K. I'm planning to do a little gaming this week with it so I'll have a chance to see how it does under my daily use. I also do a bit of Premiere and After Effects so I'm looking forward to seeing how it works there as well.Overall, this is probably way more processor than I NEED. I was still able to do what I needed to do with the 9900K. I built the 9900K in 2020 during the height of the astronomically high PC price wave. I ended up getting this processor for about $100 less than I paid for the 9900K two years ago. So the price-to-performance upgrade for me was a no brainer.If you want a fast processor at a reasonably decent price, this is a great one to get. Just be aware you will need to pay attention to your cooling.",Intel-core-i9-12000

United States,23-06-2023,"Good processor, poor internal graphics","I bought this CPU with internal graphics primarily to have backup if my primary installed GPU should fail. Also for the speed and quality of the CPU itself, it satisfies. But the internal graphics not so much. I used it's graphics for the time I was shopping and waiting for my ordered GPU and was not impressed. I would never want to depend on it permanently. My TV monitor continually had issues with detecting it's source and would drop connection on occasion, forcing me to have to continually reset HDMI cable in it's port. A real irritation and pain. Is this a problem with the MBs HDMI port or the CPU. I don't know, but either way it ain't good. Nor did I care much for the overall look of the graphics it provided. Just not quality.I have been using a big screen TV for a monitor my for many years and never had this issue, so I don't think it's the TV. Still the cost of an I7 K vs an I7 KF is negligible so why not go for the one with graphics in case I ever need it. For a short while.",Intel-core-i7-12000
United States,03-04-2022,"No problems, but don't expect typical workloads to be significantly faster either.","Processor runs reasonably cool, typically 20c less than my GPU on the same water-cooled loop. I installed Windows 11, and it shows 20 cores. Benchmarking with RDR2 shows a laughable difference from an I7-6700K, which is a 7 year old processor; it was 2-3fps on average. It's all about the GPU folks, the CPU after 7 years makes just about 1% difference.All these fools overclocking and worrying about memory latency? OK, if you're running a database or video editing; for the other 99%, this is a great processor, but it won't make a dimes worth of difference in FPS. I didn't really believe it would, but was curious how much of a difference a new CPU (that is 7 years newer), a new motherboard, and new memory would make. It makes almost no difference. I only really replaced the hardware all because I was seriously worried it was going to fail and the newer GPU will need the newer PCIE 4.0 bus. If GPUs ever become available at MSRP, I'll be set for awhile, but not holding my breath. It'll probably be 2023 before that is true again..",Intel-core-i7-12000

It's a shame that a supplier whom a customer orders a motherboard and a processor together with specifications that are incompatible and does not allow for their combination doesn't bother to inform the customer that the processor is not suitable and that with the addition of a few dollars you can order a processor that matches the characteristics of the board.

United States,17-03-2022,"ordered new cpu , got a Celeron g6900 in the box. be careful",ordered a new intel i9-12900k processor and the box was fine and sealed and all appeared to be normal with it not opened. Removed the cpu and placed into motherboard ( new lga 1700 mb with the latest bios ). booted up the system and it reported and showed a Celeron G6900. This is unacceptable. Working with amazon support on returning it now. for the replacement unit I will video opening the box and the cpu as it is removed.

This CPU does everything ""lickety split.""",Intel-core-i9-12000
United States,14-02-2022,12th Gen Tech that didn’t impress………until recently!,I bought this with a ASUS z690 gaming board and it wasn’t impressive compared to my similar i9 Core 9900k setup. Not worth upgrading unless you are a 7th Gen or older system in my opinion. Great to have ddr5 support but that isn’t really impressive either. Love intel but I feel like there is a bottleneck with processors these past few gens*****************UPDATE*****************And the ASUS totally redeemed itself with a new biosUpdate! This setup is way nice and now feel like I got my moneys worth.

United States,09-01-2022,Intel is back!,This is the second computer that I build myself. My previous one was a threadripper 2750x with 16 cores. I was very impressed with AMD at that time.  Since then it appears that the roles of AMD and Intel have switched. Intel is now offering more value for the money than AMD for similar performance.  I am ecstatic and cannot wait for what comes next.  The 12900k is a fantastic processor at this price point.,Intel-core-i9-12000
United States,17-11-2021,My son loves it!,"Bought this for my 8 year old son so he can finally run Battletoads on his Nintendo Wii. Unfortunately, his 5950x simply wasn't getting him the 420fps in-game he wanted. With Intel this is now possible.",Intel-core-i9-12000

United States,15-12-2021,WOW! This thing is FAST!,Intel has knocked it in the bleachers with this one.  Super fast.  No OC necessary.  Using it with Win11 and a 3080 gpu.  Incredible.  Not regretting it at all. Glad I decided to go with Intel on this build,Intel-core-i9-12000
United States,24-11-2021,Ran as expected,"Bought it as an upgrade from my i7 because as I told my wife - I “desperately needed an upgrade” because my 9700k was getting too slow.

Canada,10-08-2022,Fraudulent Substitution,Everything seemed okay until I placed the chip on my motherboard; something seemed wrong. A Pentium of some sort was substituted and my motherboard damaged. Amazon replaced and I am waiting for a refund on the board. Who would have thought?,Intel-core-i9-12000
United States,03-11-2023,price/performance and a little older!,"Picked this cpu up in August 2023. I upgraded from an i7 4770K to this beast. The i7 4770k was still capable, but honestly I wanted RCPS3 to run better because their getting closer to 75% of the library being playable. Also, I could tell my 8gb of g-skill sniper ram was holding me back and i could not for the life of me find 16gb of ram available that would run with trusted compatibility with my current board. The i9 12900kf hardly touches 20% usage for any new game and older games are even less usage while the video card sits at 99-100% usage, this is the sweet spot for no bottle necking and high performance.The video card is an RTX 2060 Super @ 1440P on Dell's 32"" monitor S3220DGF. With zero brightness and contrast at a hundred, the colors pop. I'd say comparable to OLED with those settings or at least IPS. The CPU is paired with the Z690 Strix motherboard and 32gb of Corsair vengeance ram. 32gb is the sweet spot. I watched a Linus Tech Tip video that said 8gb is good enough but when I run MSI afterburner along with Riva Tuner-statistics , the ram usage is usually between 10 and 12gb's used and sometimes as high as 14gb, with no known programs of mine running in the background. Perhaps we definitely passed the 8gb minimum by now. Itunes, Video Proc Converter, RPCS3, and Virtual DJ are some of my most demanding apps and this cpu just handles them like it's lite work I'm throwing at it. Well, there's the value. Highly recommending this chip but if you do go for it, be sure to pick up the Thermalright CPU Contact Frame for LGA 1700 Retrofit Kit or else, your cpu will burn, literally, that’s the only caveat to the 12th generation.",Intel-core-i9-12000
United States,12-01-2024,outstanding performance and reliability,"I recently upgraded my computer with the Intel Core i9-12900KF processor, and I am thoroughly impressed by its performance. The processor's hybrid architecture, combining Performance-cores (P-cores) and Efficient-cores (E-cores), offers an unparalleled computing experience. The multitasking capabilities are exceptional. I can run demanding applications, stream, and even engage in high-end gaming simultaneously without any lag. The P-cores deliver robust performance for heavy tasks, while the E-cores handle background activities, making everything from video editing to 3D rendering a breeze.",Intel-core-i9-12000
United States,11-05-2024,Pretty beast of a cpu,No complaints with this besides needing a strong cooler. This gets really hot.  I run every game maxed graphical settings 1440p and get over 100fps in most games easy. Had this for a year and it's still in beast mode.,Intel-core-i9-12000
United States,21-07-2022,this is the best gaming CPU yet,"i was a devoted AMD fan, until the X570 Ace started bothering me with the dreaded USB issue, after trying serval fixes, including Bios updates that came promising to fix the issue, also am a system builder since 2005, and as my part time business I build high end systems, and seeing how many stability issues AMD has from time to time I wanted to just give Intel a chance, and am glad i did, this is now in my main system, along with my trusty FTW3 3080, had to upgrade my motherboard and went with a Z690 Aero D, DDR5, am really happy with it, saw a noticeable improvement over the AMD with DDR5, at 1080p 1440p and 4k, but mainly I saw a great improvement in VR, i have to bring up that this isn't an advisable upgrade if you are running anything new gen, like AMD 5k or Intel 10th or 11th, as the differences will be negligible, but if you are in the market for the best right now, nothing that AMD offers at the moment competes as far as single core, or multi core for the most part, and ironically this time intel offers better value, good times indeed.",Intel-core-i9-12000
United States,04-04-2024,Another winner for Intel.,"This CPU is the best with 8 Cores, 16 threads and an affordable price. It is screaming fast and it doesn't get bogged down when mult-tasking.",Intel-core-i9-12000
United States,17-03-2023,Great for Linux,"I got this over a 13th Gen since it is now fairly inexpensive and still plenty fast.  I am using the Asus ROG Strix z690-E mobo so I should be able to upgrade to 13th Gen when those come down in price.  This CPU needs a good cooler, I am using a ARCTIC Liquid Freezer II 360 with Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut.  I am dual booting Linux and Win10 though I am running games mostly on Steam under Linux.  Works surprisingly well.",Intel-core-i9-12000
United States,06-10-2023,Kinda crazy that this CPU outspecs a PS5 one,Excellent CPU. Lightning fast and can handle very heavy shaders in Minecraft with ease. Unfortunately it's performance is bottlenecked by my 20 series RTX graphics card ): but when Black Friday comes I'm definitely upgrading my GPU and the full power of this absolute beast will be unlocked. This thing is next gen,Intel-core-i9-12000
United States,25-12-2023,i9-12900KF an excellent!,"Had a 11900KF prior to this one, and as fast as it was even being overclocked.and it's been so nice. P cores are freed up to do what they're supposed to do. E cores do the chores! Was hot at first before undervolting, but now that's done and temps are high 70s with a 360 mm Corsair AIO.",Intel-core-i9-12000
United States,21-05-2022,Awesome processor!,"While I was away on a deployment I wanted to come back home to a little PC project, but wanted to build something more high-end (my previous build being an i7-9700K and 2080 Super). Luckily I heard about this i9 getting on the market and I was looking at the Ryzen 5900X, but I had a good experience with my previous Intel CPU (Nothing bad with the couple Ryzen builds I’ve had either).Anyways, long story short I built this heavy PC and the CPU has been an awesome choice! I paired it with my MSI Gaming X Trio 3080 Ti and an Samsung Odyssey G7 32” monitor and thing consistently gets to the 240 fps the monitor is capable of.Here are some pics of the build. I’ve since moved the drain plug to the bottom rad since it was impractical to have it on the pump, but I saw a vid with it there so I sort of Lemming’d on that.😂 Enjoy!",Intel-core-i9-12000

United States,05-08-2023,"Run dual displays smoothly without any hiccups, here are my notes…","This item has been with me for a very short time.So I recently decided to upgrade my gaming rig, and after extensive research, I made the bold choice to order the Intel Core i7-12700K Gaming Desktop Processor with Integrated Graphics and 12 Cores. Let me tell you, this processor is the absolute best! With its 12 cores, it brings a whole new level of performance to my gaming experience. Whether I'm playing graphically demanding AAA titles or indulging in intense multitasking, this processor effortlessly handles it all. And what's even better is that it comes with integrated graphics, meaning I didn't have to shell out extra cash for a separate graphics card, yet. The integrated Graphics offer the flexibility of running dual displays smoothly without any hiccups. Plus, with Intel's reputation for reliable and high-quality products, I know I can trust the i7-12700K to last me for years to come.I hope you find this review helpful.",Intel-core-i7-12000
United States,02-12-2023,Undervolt your intel CPU!,"The morning after building and setting up windows, drivers, etc. The PC had blue screened because of temperatures, and after a reset and entering the BIOS I saw that the temperature was 89 degrees celsius. Thankfully, after some trial and error I was able to undervolt it and not have my CPU die. I'd suggest anyone who looks into getting an intel CPU to undervolt it!",Intel-core-i7-12000

United States,08-10-2022,Got unlucky first chip,Got a bad one.  Worked like crazy trying to figure out the issue and on board video was working some but not always.  Sent it back and got another that works amazing. Water coolers don't have the correct spacer for this chip but I checked the website and got one for under 10.  So factor that into your water cooling cost.,Intel-core-i7-12000
United States,18-01-2022,Great CPU for gaming and multitasking,Great CPU so far. Only limiting this CPU at the moment is the early versions of Z690 motherboard software that might not be overclocking at optimal levels (using auto overclock). Make sure you have a good CPU cooler or a cooler designed for the LGA 1700. Currently the Gigabyte settings for overclocking (bios or windows app) is pushing the CPU above spec and will cause throttling.

United States,23-10-2023,"Works well, but.....E cores suck.....and it took me a year to find the fix :(","This review is on my Intel Core i7-12700F bought over a year ago.In a nutshell, -1 star for E cores.It now runs everything I want (once I made changes that took it from a 2 star to a 4 star) fast.  I suppose that based on the age it could be a 3 star, but I am rating it as when I started using it over a year ago.  I am using Win 10 still, but I doubt (based on my new laptop) if going to Win 11 would matter.I spent over a year with some software running much slower than on my I7-8700 and my browsers would take over a minute to start working.  When I got my new I9 Win 11 laptop I found I had many of the same issues but it had software that allowed me to easily play with the problem.  Much research later and some playing around I have discovered that the E cores were the cause of my issues.  I tried several combinations with this processor but the only combination that works as expected is when *ALL* E cores are turned OFF in BIOS.Now I know that the 'powers that be' seem to claim we are causing issues by dumping the E cores, but I can not see anything but improvement by doing so (Win 10).  It may be that I am a simplistic user with gaming, simple word processing and spreadsheets, surfing and research, and Folding @ Home and do not compute in the areas that MIGHT be affected by this modification.I am now happy with this processor and wish I knew a year ago what I recently found out and implemented.  Now I blow the doors off of my old I7-8700 in all that I do.  I told several friends about this and so far I have not heard of any negatives from dumping the E cores.",Intel-core-i7-12000

United States,10-11-2021,Power efficient and a powerful gaming chip,"Don't be confused with people slamming these new chips over power efficiency. Under load yes they do draw more power than their AMD counterparts however at idle (which is what most peoples pcs are doing most of the time) they draw less than their AMD counterparts. Unless you're driving this thing full tilt all the time, it is very power efficient. Gaming performance is great and the few titles that are not working now (early adopter bugs, AMD has had more than their fair share over the years) trust me they'll be ironed out. Intel is finally back on the right track. Looking forward to future competition.",Intel-core-i7-12000

United States,22-02-2023,"I won't go into much technical detail here since there's people a lot smarter than myself who can get into the nitty gritty. Generally speaking though - this CPU absolutely smokes, especially for the price. Don't let the 'i5' name fool you. The i5-13600K (and KF) is a top-class processor that for most users, will offer more than enough performance for intensive tasks while having probably the most reasonable power consumption and cooling requirements of the top-three 13th generation Intel processors.I came from an i7-5960X - still a solid processor in this day and age but unfortunately my motherboard wasn't exactly kind to me attempting to take it above 3.8 GHz. Despite it bottlenecking against my 2080 Ti, it still ran cool under a 360mm CLC, topping out at no more than 51 degrees C gaming (GPU load) and 60 degrees under full CPU loads. But since the current market for new components is pretty good, I opted to go all in on a 13th gen build rather than find a better X99 motherboard.Odds are, you're probably going to be cross shopping the i5-13600K with the i7-13700K and the i9-13900K. Unless your workflow necessitates the additional core count or you're chasing records, the performance difference between those CPUs and the 13600K did not seem worth the hundreds of dollars of additional cost and the massive increase in peak power consumption. Power also equals heat, and that was another motivating factor for going with the 13600K, having been accustomed to a relatively cool and quiet build for some time. That said; with the additional cores and much higher boost frequency, I was expecting higher peak power draw and temps despite a lower TDP on paper.And they were definitely higher, under the same 360mm CLC. After running benchmarks with Cinebench and 3DMark, I was hitting peak temps in the mid-to-high 70s under full CPU loads. Gaming loads however were definitely more manageable though, sitting in the 40s and seldom breaking 50 degrees, which was actually a small but appreciable improvement over the 5960X. I'd advise at minimum a high quality air cooler or a 240mm CLC for this processor.The out of the box performance is something else though. I managed to hit 23345 on a multi-core Cinebench test and a 16459 combined score on 3DMark Time Spy. Again, this is stock clocks paired with an overclocked 2080 Ti and 32GB of DDR5 at 5600 MHz. At 3440 x 1440 and 144Hz, games run like butter. I could dabble in overclocking it since I have the headroom but honestly, I don't see the point. It's fantastic as is.All in all, I feel like the 13600K is kind of the no-brainer option for most people looking to put together a high-end system on a budget. You're getting most of the performance of it's more expensive stablemates for a much lower price and less obnoxiously high power and cooling requirements. The KF is also a little cheaper if you don't need integrated graphics. Just buy it. You'll love it.",The performance bargain of the century.,Intel-core-i5-13000

United States,11-04-2024,"I was on the fence about upgrading from i5 12400f, which is a beast of a cpu. Some pros and cons.  My specs: RTX 4070ti,  z790 ddr5 gigabyte mobo, 32 gb fury ram, 1tb WD black SSD gen 4.Pros:More coresNoticeably faster in some areas like booting and some applications.Some triple A GPU bound games will get a noticeable FPS boost. (Not huge, talking 3-10 at most).CPU bound games (emulators for me) will get much better stability and cpu usage reduction.Cons:If you are looking for energy efficiency these 13th gen and higher chips are NOT it. More cores means more energy draw for sure. On Triple A games the chip is using 20-30 watts more electricity. In emulators like RPCS3 it’s nearly double. I went from 30- 40 watt average to average 80 and in some instances spiked above 100. The good thing is emulators are much less GPU bound so the wattage balances out, sort of.Heat- I’m running an AIO lian li 360 Galahad, with the 12400f I was nearly always running at room temp (my house gets lots of shade and stays cool/cold) so I was used to 22c range. With the 13600k you  will see a 10 degree increase even at idle. Emulators will get into the 60s while triple A games 40s and 50s. With the 12400f my fan curve rarely ever triggered high fan speeds. With the 13th gen you will definitely hear those fans work at load.Side notes I tried the 13600k on two mobos (z790 and 690) you can use it on older 690 compatible mobos, you just need to flash bios to latest. It was super easy on the gigabyte z790 and 690 mobo.Overall. The performance jump is noticeable in some games. But far more noticeable is the increase in heat and wattage usage. If you have a 12th gen and are on the fence you really don’t need to upgrade, however depending on what you are doing with it could be the main factor. I wanted my RPCS3 to run at 60fps in 4k constantly and the 13600k did the trick.  (playing MGS4 guns of the patriots in 4k and stable is unreal!)",Coming from i5 12400f,Intel-core-i5-13000

Japan,19-02-2023,基本、CPUは「金さえ出せば」もっと早い物は買えるだが、資金に余裕がある人ばかりではないので、予算を何処まで出せるか？で、折り合いを付けなければいけない。だが、１５０００円までの予算でも12100か13100の４コア８スレッドが帰る事から、「とりあえず」購入する先としてはこの２つがメインになるとは思う。因みにこの２つは「中身は全く同じ（厳密にいえば、リフレッシュしている分、若干の差異はあるが）」なので、１２世代も１３世代も、ほぼ違いなど無い。ただ、新規で１３世代を使う人が居た場合、むしろマザーボードで悩むのでは？ぶっちゃけ「７００番台買う意味ってM.2が１つGen３からGen4になる程度の差」でしかないからね。後は「USBが20Gbitに対応する」ぐらいではなかろうか？あんまり意識しないのなら、１３世代のCPUに、６００番台のマザボでもいいのでは？安く買えるし。ただ、本題はココからで、13400にはEコア４つある事での、全体的な「安定感」が侮れない。一般にPコア４つある１２１００や１３１００にもHTがあるので、スレッド処理は８コアに見える分、それなりに高速に処理してくれる。だが、アプリやソフトが動く時もそうでないときも、バックグラウンドでは「OSの処理が常に動いている」ので、Pコアに休む時間は無く、常に何割かはOSの処理に使われる為に、ソフトの処理に「Pコアの全リソースを注ぎ込めない」のは、当然の話になっている。そして話は佳境になるが、早い話「Eコア４つに、OSの処理を受け持ってもらう」という事が出来る事に、最大の意味がある。仕様上、Pコアは「人間が意図して動かさなければ、動作停止する」仕様になっているので、特にソフトが走っていない状況なら「Eコアのみ」が動作する環境になる。当然消費電力もぐっと下がるのもあるし、何よりも「Pコアの性能を全部、ソフトにつぎ込める」事が、とても大きな意味を持つ。何よりも「OSの処理をEコアに任せられる分、安定動作が確実になる」事に、最大の価値がある。ちなみに「末尾にK」が付くシリーズは、性能が高くなる分、消費電力が２倍とかに跳ね上がるので、注意が必要。電気代を気にしない人ならいいが、普通にワットパフォーマンスが最悪なので。また、i９などは、常に１００度とかになり、最高速度を出す為には、電源周りが優秀な高級マザーボードが必須の上で、無茶苦茶冷える水冷キットが本当に必須。熱だれで、常に速度低下になるのが分かり切っているので。話は長くなったが、１３４００は「中身は１２世代の12600をリメークした」ものではあるが、だからこそ、コストパフォーマンスは最高傑作。３万弱で、安定動作するCPUは他にない（上位を買えば電気代さえ無視すれば、いっぱいあるが）ので、お勧めの１つ。,コスパ最強。,Intel-core-i5-13000

Japan,05-08-2023,AviUtlのx265で1080p動画のCPUエンコードに60fps出るのは驚きました。同じエンコード設定で他のPCと比較すると・・・Core 2 Quad Q8200は5fps (AVX命令がないSSE4時代なのでお察し)Celeon N4100は5fps (4コアAtom≒Core 2 Quadの法則)Ryzen 5 3500Uは7fps (Zen+のAVX256は内部的にSSE4相当の128bit処理で激遅)Ryzen 5 Pro 3400GEは17fps (Zen+なのでお察し。体感Sandy Bridgeと同程度)Core i7 4770は20fps (Zen+より速いがHaswellなので時代遅れ感否めず)Ryzne 5 5500Uは25fps (型番詐欺のZen2、6コアだが2.5GHzしか出ない)Core i5 1135G7は30fps (AVX512対応で4コアの割に速い。2023年現在もワッパ最強説)Ryzen 7 Pro 5750GEは45fps (Zen3はAVX512非対応で8コアの割に遅い)SSE/AVXとか知らない人向けに捕捉。SSE/AVX(いわゆるSIMD命令)はCPUの演算レジスタ(最近のは256～512bit)を変数型(8～64bit)に合わせて細分化し、計算を並列化する技術です。AVX256では8bit変数を32並列で計算しているが、AVX512なら64並列で計算できるということです。最近のCPUの性能はほぼAVX命令の速度で決まります。特に動画のエンコードや生成AIの速度はAVX命令の優劣が如実に表れます。intelはHaswell Refresh(第4世代)の頃からAVX命令が速くて動画変換に強いのと、アイドル時は700MHz程度まで落ち込む(Ryzenだとせいぜい1.4GHz程度)ので省電力性能も高いのが良いですね。ただし、電力リミットが全然働かないマザーボードだと冷却に苦労します。TDP65W向けのCPUクーラーではサーマルスロットリングで3.0GHz程度に落ち込みます。それでも上記の性能が出るので大したものです。立派なCPUクーラーを付けたら常時4.0GHz前後で動くのでしょうね。AtomからXeonまで幅広いCPUを作っているintelが得意とするP-Core(シングル性能特化)とE-Core(効率・マルチ性能重視)の異種混合CPUも2代目。製造プロセス(nm値)ではAMDやARMに遅れがちですが、やはりアーキテクチャ技術や命令セットではまだまだintelが優れているのかなと思います。Tiger Lake(11世代)以下から乗り換えれば性能倍増も夢ではないので、技術の進歩に驚くばかりです。内蔵GPUは実行ユニット数32個 (Tiger Lakeのi5 1135G7だと80個もある) なのでオマケ程度と割り切るべきでしょう。少しでもゲームをする気があるなら素直にビデオカード増設を。しかしビデオカードがなくてもモニタ出力できるのは便利です。最近はi5ですら円安で3.5万円もかかるから悩ましい。昔だったら同じ値段でi7が買えていたのに。。。最近は5000円程度の激安マザボもなくなり、安くて1.5万円はかかる時代なのでCPU+マザボだけで5万円コースに。。。それでもいい買い物をしたと思っています。【2023/10/29追記】CPUクーラーを交換してTDP65W縛りをやめた結果...。定格65WのCPUを電力制限無視して実質OCしているようなものなので仕方ないとは思いますが、GIGABYTE B760M DS3H DDR4にてTDP125W設定で使用していると、CPU電圧が1.4Vを超えたあたりから動作が不安定になります。TDP100W設定のCPU電圧1.3V程度で使うと安定します。やたらCPU電圧を盛りたがるマザボでは使用しない方が良さそうです。,x265 1080p slow設定で60fpsエンコード可能,Intel-core-i5-13000

This processor at an affordable price more than doubled, maybe tripled my cpu performance while still accepting my older DDR4 3200 ram and m.2 storage.  Also allows me to update my machine to Windows 11 as a 13th gen cpu.  I considered running 8th gen chip in my older mother board by flashing the bios with a coffee lake chip support, but rather than deal with all the isolation on the cpu pins and bios frustration, i opted to spend 60 bucks for a new MATX board and this cpu.  The only complaint I have is the cpu box was clearly opened and I am left wondering if this was dropped into someone else's board at some point and returned.  I don't like that when the product is being advertised as new.  The seller was Amazon LLC too so I am not sure what is going on with that.  I have half a mind to return it for a replacement but alas it is installed and seems to be running fine so I really don't want to pack it up and ship it back.

Canada,06-01-2022,"As of January 2022, the motherboards (B560 chipset. Don't really use H series...) are not so pricy (under $200 at most. Mostly a bit lower than $150) and 3200 MHz DDR4 rams are cheap, pairing this CPU with budget is still a good build.Of course, this CPU will be phased out by 12400 which was released to market a few days ago. But the motherboards and DDR5 ram kits might still not be 'budget' option (due to shortages and tariffs... and scalpers...) until at least 1st quarter of 2022. So, 11400 is still worth it.This 11th generation is released due to Intel's desperation to catch up AMD's counterparts. In other words, 11400 is an emergency patch-up to squeeze out as much as they could. So, 11400 doesn't really have too much performance increase for gaming against 10400 and heats up quite a lot.But workstation usage is different! If you're looking for a budget workstation, getting this while B560 boards are cheap and easy to get is not a bad option. 12400 is also a budget option which can be paid out with this CPU when the parts for 12400 becomes actually 'budget.' I do not recommend pairing this CPU with anything lower than B560 chipset. Losing memory overclocking and PCI-E gen 4 renders this CPU nothing better than 10400 which is almost $50 cheaper.If you're a gamer, just wait a few more months to get 12th generation when all the other parts (maybe not GPU but you might already have one already at this point) becomes budget friendly. They say B660 boards will not be too expensive but who knows what will happen with this 'Omicron' variant?The included cooler is good enough for gaming (if you can't your case airflow needs some revision... or cleaning at least) but the cooler can't handle any heavy CPU load such as compiling a project, running simulations, etc. It surely is improved compared to those crap cookies with only aluminum fins, bundled with up to 10th generation, but the 11th generation's architecture still generates too much heat for the black OEM cooler for its maximum usage.",Good compromise between budget and performance.,Intel-core-i5-13000

United States,31-03-2021,"If you're looking to build a mid-range system and either don't need dedicated graphics or are waiting for the prices of graphics cards to return to the realm of sanity, this CPU is an excellent option, especially if paired with a B560 motherboard.  If you are planning on using a separate graphics card, check out the cheaper i5-11400F.  While the upper tiers of the newly-released 11th Gen Rocket Lake have received criticism for poor value relative to 10th Gen and poor performance relative to Ryzen 5000 series, the 11400 is a solid value.  It's a solid improvement over the 10400, and it is currently extremely difficult to acquire AMD processors with integrated GPUs.Quick review of Intel nomenclature:  An ""F"" designates a CPU without integrated graphics.  ""K"" designates an unlocked CPU that allows overclocking.  So the 11400 is a locked CPU with integrated graphics, while the 11400F is a locked CPU that will require a separate graphics card.All Intel CPUs (even non-K ones) technically allow for *memory* overclocking, just not overclocking the CPU itself.  However, previously, their B-series motherboards prevented memory overclocking, limiting RAM speeds to 2933MHz, and you had to buy an expensive Z-series board to use faster RAM.But with the 11th Gen, the B560 motherboards now support memory overclocking, thus improving the performance of budget and mid-range systems.  So a system built with an 11400F and B560 motherboard represents an excellent value.  If you don't need a GPU, or want to wait for prices to come down, getting an 11400 and using the integrated graphics is a very compelling option.",Excellent choice if you don't need dedicated graphics,Intel-core-i5-13000

United States,01-04-2021,"Well, this is a pretty bad time to be a pc gamer. On top of the chip shortages, scalpers, and crypto mining craze, you can't even find a decent cpu with integrated graphics that plays modern games for less than $400... until now.Intel's 11th generation Core processors are pretty lackluster, however, they do have one thing going for them. The integrated graphics is good enough to play most esports titles @ 720p and medium settings over 60 fps. Not only that, it also comes priced under $200 and you can actually buy it.I was able to use this paired with the ASRock B560m Pro4/ac and 3200Mhz CL16 RAM to get a very nice system setup. ASRock let's the CPU stay clocked at 4.2-4.4Ghz at all times which is nice. I was also able to undervolt the vCore by -100mV and the temps came down good enough. Max load power consumption hits around 85-90 watts. Using the Aresgame River 5 cpu cooler, temps sit at 28C idle and 52C max load.I really can't find anything negative to say about this processor, it will definitely last you for several years once you get a graphics card.

Idle temps get down to about 36 C.Power consumption:When undervolted, nothing I do on a daily basis puts it anywhere past 40W, period. When idle, I am seeing it use just 4-5W.

For most of what I use a computer for, this is way overkill, even for most PC games I play. My RTX 3070 graphics card is now the bottleneck in games, by a long shot (though that's fine, as 1440p fps is still plenty high enough in most games with that graphics card).I used Intel XTU (extreme tuning utility) to overclock my i5-13600k, and stress tested for stability. Easy to overclock to 5.4ghz on performance cores, with no heat issues and perfect stability that won't meaningfully shorten the processor lifespan. It's capable of higher clocks (various people have clocked to 5.6ghz, or the highest I've seen so far is 6.1ghz achieved by a pro, no doubt with extreme cooling solution. The small overclock from 5.1 to 5.4 made substantial difference already in frames/sec in games as well as benchmarks - not that stock wasn't good enough as is for everything I use it for.

If you're upgrading to 13th gen Intel, and don't require the additional non-gaming related benefits of 13700k or 13900k, you can't go wrong with the i5-13600k. Even with XMP enabled to 6000Mhz & a Noctua NH-U12A tower cooler on top, this beast never gets truly hot in any game. Granted, I have a very good case for airflow, but regardless it's extremely rare I ever see this CPU hitting the 70's when gaming (this includes 1440p gaming at basically maxed settings), with plenty of utilization headroom on top of that. I paired this beastly CPU with the Sapphire Nitro Plus Radeon 6950XT & have been having an amazing experience all around. If you're deeply considering 13th gen, & your main focus is gaming, then the 13600k will perform up there with the best without all the additional heat the higher end SKU's give off. Genuinely give this CPU a 10/10, never in my life did I ever anticipate an i5 to be this great, but just goes to show it's more about the generation and less about the number after the i.

United States,24-01-2024,"I recently decided to build my first custom pc and I was debating what cpu to use. Since I mostly work as a designer and content creator, I needed a good high-performance low cost cpu.

In overclocking performance this thing beats the I9-12900K, and rivals the I7-14700K.It runs pretty hot though, so you'll need a good cooler. Since I had a tight budget I went with the Deepcool AK400 WH, but you would probably want to go with an AIO. The integrated graphics are amazing, and everything ran smoothly straight out of the box.

United States,26-05-2024,"Amazing processor, but check your CPU power management in BIOS","So, first thing's first. This is a genuinely powerful CPU that's been able to handle basically every task that I've thrown at it. It runs demanding tasks like encoding and gaming with ease.Now with that out of the way; Thermals. This thing gets hot, and I mean REALLY hot. If you're going with air cooling I strongly recommend a double tower, six/eight pipe Air cooler like the Corsair A115 or a Cooler Master MA824. If you are going the AIO route, anything LESS than a 360mm AIO will under perform. For that, go with any 360mm AIO from any brand of your choice. If you have the space, go with a 420mm AIO for the best results.Finally, there has been recent reports of CPU degradation and instability when using this CPU. I am using this with an asus ROG STRIX Z790-H motherboard and it basically JUICED the CPU like no tomorrow until I applied intel's Power settings for this CPU. This likely is the cause of the degradation. Be sure to check intel's website for recommended power settings. Also check your motherboard vendor for any bios updates as Intel has confirmed that many motherboard vendors are running the i9 13900k CPU out of intel's specifications.In conclusion here's my personal experience: The CPU functions, but I can not use Asus' AI Overclocking feature as I get a BSOD with the CLOCK_WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT error and apps will randomly crash. You probably shouldn't use any AI assisted overclocking feature if you can help it. Even running this at stock, there is still a substantial amount of performance in this CPU. If you have an older rig and are looking to upgrade your CPU, I would just wait for Meteorlake or just go with AMD.Final note: I am not using a contact frame on my motherboard for my CPU.",Intel-core-i9-13000

But it's doing its job I guess.. in my 2 weeks of usage I have seen it's temprature rised above 80°C once. Wasn't expecting that from current refined and powerful generations. I am using liquid cooling on top of this. And yet it hit 80°C. What I was doing when that happened was trying to open a game. And one thing that I missed was to disable the integrated graphics because I have dedicated GPU. It was just for a moment the CPU was used during the game launch and after it started using the GPU. But until that switch happened, under less than a minute of CPU usage, it reached to 80°c. I mean since these are premium products, there should be some protection layers blocking such usages, and close the programs instead rather than hitting its performance.But anyways, I disabled the integrated device and then it's all smooth. Everything normal except for that one instance explained above. Parallel processing is still shitty though with Windows OS. Same kind of processors on Mac before Apple silicon came in were working more efficiently. So I guess it's prob with windows OS, but not processors.",Intel-core-i9-13000
Canada,31-05-2024,Surprisingly Fast but watch out for corner chip escapes,"We set up multiple computing servers to run heavy video processing algorithms essentially continuously everyday - to make a long story short, we liked how fast this ran compared to the i7-11th gen we had from before.The surprising thing is one day among 8 essentially identical machines, we noticed one desktop that seemed much hotter than the others.  We hooked up measurement of power draw and temperature readings of the CPUs and was shocked that this one was drawing 450W as others were showing < 200W.  And temperature went up to 100C while the others were at 70C.One system had a glitch where if you ran python and import numpy, it would reboot.  We determined the problem was that PSU only supported +12V rail at 20A.  We switched to a 600W PSU that supports +12V @50A and it worked flawlessly.  So watch out that your PSU supplies sufficient amps at +12V.Ordered a replacement, replacement brand new would not boot up.  We swapped back old CPU from, and it boots up but runs hot again.  This one we had to reduce workload to 75% of other systems to cool it down.So 2 out of 10 desktops are defective  This is a huge surprise.

United States,22-04-2023,Wow!,"Best investment I ever made when it comes to a gaming/streaming pc. I’m a pretty hardcore gamer and this cpu is the most amazing thing I’ve ever had when it comes to a high end build. I paired it with a rtx 4080 and needless to say this cpu doesn’t disappoint. Now, this review isn’t about pricing because we all know this cpu is expensive and honestly if you’re only gaming then maybe a 13600k would suffice. However, if you are streaming, photo editing, video editing etc…. Then this is the right cpu for you. I’m able to snap together YouTube videos in seconds NOT minutes or anywhere near it. I’m able to stream and game at the same time with less than a 10 fps loss while gaming and streaming on the highest quality settings. My wife loves it for photo editing bc everything is just perfect. Only downside is that it does run hot but you can get a good 240-360mm aio that will tame this cpu with ease. All the issues I use to have on the 10th gen platform are completely irradiated now that I own this cpu. I did go with the ddr5 and honestly for me it runs better than ddr4. Tech reviewers say otherwise but from personal experience ddr5 is the future NOW. Performance issues I use to have with ddr4 and weaker cpus are just gone now. I can do so much and this cpu doesn’t break a sweat. For instance, ddr4 for whatever reason sometimes wouldn’t work with xmp although it was advertised. I like to tinker so it wasn’t an issue BUT sometimes it’s just nice to do a single click and let it dial itself in and that’s what ddr5 has done for me. I’ve used several different sticks with this cpu and from all of them I went with Corsair vengeance. Honestly, this is the most bada$$ cpu I’ve ever owned or seen in a personal system of mine. If you have the money I couldn’t recommend it enough. Everybody has different needs and in my case I needed this cpu. It hasn’t disappointed. As for amd, if you want the bugs and issues go ahead and grab one of those cpus and tell me how that goes. This cpu can do everything and more.

United States,22-11-2022,Insane performance,"Cinebench R23 scores: 40,345 MT / 2,284 STUpgrading from the Ryzen 5950X, this processor has some significant uplift, particularly in the single-core speed. Minimal overclocking headroom as Intel has already milked 90% of the performance on stock settings. However, with some tweaking, you're likely to get up to 6.2 Ghz boost behavior for single-core loads, and bump up the all-core boost to 5.7 Ghz (up from 5.5 Ghz stock). With some further tweaking of the voltage-frequency curve, you could probably tweak this even further. I'm not a big fan of all-core overclocks on these type of processors, as you will lose the boosting single-core speed. In my opinion, this processor shines for gaming because of its single-core boosting performance.Memory controller has been significantly improved over Alder Lake. I was easily able to get my DDR5 6400 XMP profile running without any tweaking. I'm pretty sure this can be easily pushed further, but it seems like around 6400 Mhz memory is the roughly the sweet spot in terms of price vs performance.Very power hungry, but despite the bad reputation from reviewers, the power consumption can be easily tamed. If you run power limits unlocked, you will likely be thermal limited due to thermal throttling at 100c. However, you don't need unlocked power limits - you're talking about a very small 5-10% performance uplift but using >100W more power to achieve this. I would suggest running it at stock power limits, or unlocked power limits but seriously consider undervolting.On a final note, I wouldn't consider getting the rumored 6.0 Ghz version of the 13900K in the future. The current 13900K can easily be pushed to >6 Ghz boost speeds and will save you money.",Intel-core-i7-13000
United States,16-11-2022,good . temp issues are overblownw,"i upgraded from 5900xt. I got the msi board z690 -a for 159, and this the 13900kf. I ‘ve been wanting a cpu with an IGPU for years, but couldn’t justify the price increase on the gpu version. I actually use a dgpu but it really is convenient, and they can be used to accelerate some work. Again, before you judge i'm using this for work, productivity. NOT gaming. I would spend 200 for a gaming cpu.my use case is productivity. i’m a developer, and this is the sole reason i upgraded. I was fighting windows freezing and slowing down during a lot of my workflows. I use wsl intellj, docker, react apps java etc, often at the same time. It’s pretty noticeable the improvement. It really helped.  Like that i could use ddr4 for now since the boards are about 150 it was acceptable.Heat: The cpu gets a bad reputation due to heat and wattage. I put this in the bucket frankly that amd got as well. I mean it’s fine they are using as much power as needed to maximize perf. I limited the cpu to 250w, and it runs on a d15 cooler than my 5900, Full load can get up to high 80c, but working is 30’s. you lose very little perf by running it more in the zone. I don't know about other boards but that msi one sure makes it easy and the price if right.About the cpu: it has a ton of cores, I didn't need to buy ddr5--  i need quite a lot of ram and it still costs too much for the benefit it provides in my workload. The memory controller on 13gen is far better than ryzen 5000 series. I couldn't before get my ddr4 stable at 4000 on the 5900x and it did it on the intel one immediately. Indeed i was even able to tighten up the timings just a touch. So modern processors (and i'd assume the amd ones as well) have made welcome improvements to memory support. Id' say if you don't need as much ram say 32gb, and you don't have ddr4 already to tide you over i'd consider getting ddr5 though.  I mean nothing is cheaper than what you have and 4k speed is fine. If i had nothing or maybe some old ram i'd go w/ ddr5.Price: For 570 it’s decent deal here. It is more than i love spending, but for what you get it is a lot better than what amd is offering at the time i write this which was 700.I do wish intel supported board reuse down the line, but that even can. be overblown (to an extent, and only an extent) though it's a selling feature to me frankly reuse!! I had to really think about that. I don't understand why intel is so stubborn on this subject.  with my amd cpu i went from 2700x to 5900x and the board went from a 470 to 570 because i waned more io and better pcie but i also gave that board to my kid and upgraded it one time. With intel especially I mean i just buy cheap boards anyway and upgrade more because there are a ton of features that get added half the time. I usually try to spend about 150 on a board, though it. is getting harder but it would be more my preference. I 'm not really onboard with the 600 motherboards. Is there a  300 one in-between i guess so but that's equally unappealing to me esp w/ out the upgrade.Tips/A rant if you will: trust me on this that msi board for 159 is so amazing. It really works great. don’t worry about the vrm. that’s also very overblown too. you can go calculate the amperage this will not come close. ALso msi is a great brand and the bios is easy to navigate. If you want fancy audio buy a dac that you can reuse and plug into usb and keep reusing it. Just think about what you really need in there. The msi board has a nice selection of pcie slots and well placed nvme. I use multiple gpu one nvidia gpu quatro for encoding (its a small one) and and amd one 6900 i bought for 570 for gaming. I just really love the layout connectivity and features of the board. They cut all the stuff i don't need and pared with the cpu it's all together about 700 for a cpu and board, pretty much as good as you can get.",Intel-core-i7-13000
United States,06-12-2023,"Would never buy it again, but really glad I did.","This thing runs SO HOT. It literally tries to destroy itself.A lot of people underclock it to avoid the heat issues, but I instead just monitor it closely.Make certain you have a strong CPU cooler. Under load (GTA5 for instance) it absolutely will hit 90c+.I mostly use it for work (npm), where it shines.

United States,06-04-2023,Fast,"It's fast, and works better than my space heater for keeping the desk undersides warm. Too warm, really.UPS says the computer is using 575 watts during the CPU stress test, about 175 watts at idle. TPU is 253w ... so with the 80%+ PS inefficiency, 300w makes sense.When using the 3080 GPU with the i9 CPU ... well, the heat coming from the case is similar to a 1000w space heater, really. Now reconsidering my choice for only an 850w PS. 1000w would probably be a better idea for this beast.As for speed. That's relative. But I am coming from an i9-7900x, and this is 3x faster, and it feels 3x faster. Memory is slower, (4ch vs 2ch) -- so I had to use DDR5-6400 to get a similar memory bandwidth. Lost some latency, but the overall effect is the thing still seems plenty fast.I dislike the way the CPU case instantly jumps to 100c -- no thermal mass what-so-ever in the CPU case. Or I have a bad CPU without whatever filler Intel puts between the die and the case.In any case, Intel needs to allow for more thermal mass to reduce these thermal stresses of instantaneous temp changes. Has to be stressing the silicon and lead to more thermal stress failures.",Intel-core-i7-13000

United States,22-02-2023,"The best CPU I have ever had, and good price, too.  But beware of Z690 motherboards","I got this and a new DDR5 motherboard with Z690 chipset.  It didn't boot when I set it all up.  It turns out the Z690 needs a BIOS update to work with this CPU.  Luckily I had an older i7 that worked on this motherboard.  I dropped it in and it booted, then I did the BIOS update.  After that it boots this CPU just fine.Before this I was a die-hard AMD supporter.  I had 5950x with 16 cores, 32 threads, and 72MB of cache.  But, it just doesn't compete with this i9.  I haven't tried the 7950x, but I read that the P-cores just blow away the AMD cores.  Even with less cache.  The setup of 8 performance cores, and 16 efficiency cores just works.  It stays much cooler than earlier i9's and the AMD.  I use a water cooler, but it's not required.  Nothing slows this down when paired with DDR5.I wish the AMD was better, I like the company more.  But, I want the best of the best, and as of today there is nothing better than this available.  If you game, or do graphics, or anything on your PC this is the CPU for you.  It will NOT disappoint.A word on the X790 chipset.  You would think they will have better performance because they are newer.  They don't.  They will work with the i9 no matter what, while the Z690 might need a BIOS update.  They have one more USB port.  But otherwise there is no benefit to getting Z790 and they cost a LOT more.  So, if you have the ability to use an older CPU to flash the bios, or find one that is new enough that it doesn't need the update, this CPU will be great.",Intel-core-i9-13000

I purchased the most up to date CPU and other components with the hope this one will last me as long as the last one did. Overall I think this is a great CPU, however it is a bit frustrating when you try to cool these things. Intel just keeps pushing these CPUs harder and harder to try and beat the performance metrics of AMD, but in the process they are making CPUs that are anywhere from near impossible to difficult at best to keep cool. After a lot of tweaking in the BIOS I finally got this one to stay below the 90 degree Celsius threshold, but that doesn't account for how hot it still makes my room when I'm gaming. The extra heat was kind of nice during the winter months, but as summer is approaching I'm wondering how this is going to pan out...Anyway, the CPU is completely as advertised and worked flawlessly out of the box. I didn't run into any errors or issues with this CPU. Overall I 100% recommend it because Intel has never let me down. I've been building my own systems for more than 20 years now too, so that's a pretty long track record of CPUs that just worked and never died.

United States,24-09-2023,"If it runs hot, its probably a motherboard issue","Installed fine. My MSI motherboard wants to run it at the power levels it would for a K processor. And it actually works fine, just gets hot really fast. As seen under HWMonitor, it will hit the 100 degree thermal throttle limit when any significant benchmark program is run.  I worked around this by changing the cooler profile in the MSI bios from ""liquid"" to either ""tower air"" or ""box"".  ""Box"" profile  changes the automatic PL1 and PL2 settings to run as the i9-13900 non-K spec limits.  For a little overclocking performance, I set ""tower air cooling"" mode in the bios and experimented with slightly lower PL1 and PL2 settings as well as lowering the throttle limit from 100 to 95 degrees.

United States,05-01-2024,Check to make sure your board is compatible!,"This is my experience, I doubt that this is actually a problem with the processor itself, and more compatibility issue of the motherboard that I put it on, but I expected because it ran on 400 and 500 series motherboards that that meant that since mine is a 400 that it would run on it, I was wrong, the PC would not post when I put this processor on, I tried exchanging for another, and it did the same thing PC would not boot at all, it would go into a turn on then off then on then off then on then off then on then off cycle where nothing would actually show up on the monitor just my case fans would light up and then turn off and then light up and then turn off. So I don't know if the problem is with the processor or if I have a board compatibility issue, but I think I should not have had a board compatibility issue, and I have a 900 W power supply so there's no reason why there wasn't enough power to boot, I also used a liquid cooler so it should have had zero heat problems. I put a 12,900K on my motherboard from a 12700 KF which is what came with the computer, and the 12900K boots just fine. I am running a Lenovo legion t5 Gen 7.

United States,19-01-2024,"Sudden total CPU failure, then stuck in warranty hell.","This Intel Core i9-13900KF worked great until it failed suddenly after a year. There was no simple way to diagnose that it was this CPU that had dies, it still looks like new, and the way it failed… I was just working and then the system shut down abruptly. The motherboard would not boot into the BIOS, just LED lights and it displayed the “00” error. Finally after eliminating everything else, thankfully ASUS motherboard support were responsive, then I tried another graphics card, then I bought a cheap CPU and installed that in its place, and with the cheap CPU the system was immediately back. So it was clear that this CPU was the culprit.Intel has a warranty that is still covering it, but Intel’s support is excruciating, and has so many steps, from downloading a special app just to read the serial number on the CPU, to setting up an Intel account that does not show my support case, so i always have to use their special link to access it, and then there is the endless slowness of it all, I am still waiting for them to get back to me, even though I quickly provided all the evidence that the CPU was at fault, they just go days on end without responding to the case, then there is another thing I have to do, and I do it immediately, then I wait and wait. So I would definitely go with AMD over Intel in the future. A sudden failure like this is a major disruptor to my work and life, and it has been long enough that I found another computer to use instead and the warranty feels like Intel wants to make it more trouble than it is worth. Maybe that is why Intel has fallen from grace, I know AMD stock has been recommended over Intel by Motley Fool. Sudden hardware failure is not okay to begin with, but the difficulty of diagnosing it and then making the warranty process into a kind of torture, that put me off Intel for good.It failed, without warning and I never overclocked, just normal desktop use. Then getting support and warranty coverage is excruciating. Even though they acknowledge that it is the CPU  will be covered, they just stopped responding to the warranty case, with so many steps to go through and several days for them to respond to even the smallest update, I would not go through Intel’s support again, definitely going with AMD next time.",Intel-core-i7-13000

Intel has finally acknowledged this issue, search ""Regarding Reports of 13th/14th Gen Unlocked Desktop Users Experiencing Stability Issues"" on google.For me, worked great for about a month, then slowly started experiencing stability issues. Games would crash and get an occasional blue screen. After about 6 months, there were noticeable stability issues, with many games unable to boot past main menu, causing blue screen on launch, or experiencing frequent crashes. Friends in separate friend groups would always comment on my computer issues, showing bugs and crashes that have no apparent causes.After a year, my PC can only run super smash brothers melee with stability and even chrome tabs are crashing now. Discord has to be run on chrome because the app crashes every 10 seconds, I can't play any games. I had dedicated tens of hours into investigating only to realize it's been the CPU all along. I also had to upgrade my motherboard to accommodate this CPU and now I have to investigate if this CPU has caused irreparable damage to the motherboard. I expect Intel will be facing heavy financial losses due to influx of warranties as the issues become more and more public.Please look up ""Intel 13th and 14th Gen stability"" for more info, or ""Intel Raptor Lake stability"" on Google for further cases.

I try windows 10.... still issues.  I try reinstalling it 2 more times, still the same issue.I decide to go to Micro Center to have them diagnose the issue, while i am there, their windows 10 install crashes with the same error code.  They take it in, and in 2 days message me saying its the CPU.  They tried the CPU in a different motherboard and the issue still shows up.  So, i go and pick up the machine.I try to file a warrenty claim with Intel, but their login system was broken for a week, so I had to chat with a support person.  We spend 1 hour typing about the issue.  I send him screenshots of the CPU itself, the text from Microcenter, the recepit from Amazon, screenshot of the Bios showing all my hardware information, a screenshot of the recepit from microcenter, a screenshot of the error code.I wait a week or so, i can finally log into Intel website, and i dont see a support ticket.  I open up chat again,  i tell them my ticket and they tell me that it wasnt assigned to an email address.  They assign it and forward the support response to me.And the response says, they cant contact Microcenter to confirm it.  And that its not a CPU issue anyways because that code is due to an OS issue.An OS issue.  I ask them to reiterate their point, because if its an OS issue, that means they dont believe me and Microcenter.  I also pointed out again that i have installed Windows 10 and 11 at least 5 times.... and they respond with, i need documentation from Microcenter.  So, they dont believe me and they believe this is an OS issue still.It has been 11 days and they wont move forward unless I send the documentation from Micro Center now.Works great, but hope you never have to file a warrenty claim because its going to take at least a month and thats if your lucky.",Intel-core-i9-13000

Almost all deserve 5 stars (commented if one or more stars are taken off). Instead of reviewing item by item I decided to write one review for all products used for one specific PC build. The purpose of this PC build - fancy compact gaming system.Items used in this build:--Item 1) OCPC Mini ITX Case, Hydra Italy Mini ITX PC Case, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BK6D77DG/Very good case – compact, cool looking and efficient. The black color is the only variant I found on Amazon. With only cooling from top-down CPU cooler, the i7-13700K based system passed the stress test very well. Riser cable is not included – actually the riser cable for GPU orientation as shown on Amazon item photo does not exist. In order to build the system as shown, I bought a flexible riser cable (Item #2) and twisted it to 180°. Another simpler solution is to install GPU upside down as presented by other reviewers on Amazon.--Item 2) EZDIY-FAB PCIE 4.0 16x Extreme High Speed Flexible Riser Cable PCI Express Port GPU Extension Card-Dual Reverse Connector for ITX [21cm]. Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09S5DW3RX/-Does the job - exactly what I need for the project. Note: During system build I have to remove the bracket from the cable male connector and install it back after passing cable through the case hole.--Item 3) Power supply: Cooler Master V750 SFX Gold Full Modular, 750W, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08LP7B7FM/- Works as supposed to. PSU had a noticeable burning smell for about 5 days, considering this is normal for a new PSU. If you want to build more powerful gaming system, I recommend the PCIe 5.0 ready 850W SFX PSU, something like ARESGAME GL850 https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CHDS4J33/SFX-L PSU will work in Hydra Mini as well, but cable management will be tougher.--Item 4) CPU: Intel Core i7-13700K, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BCF57FL5/- Good CPU, working well in gaming.--Item 5) Motherboard: ASUS ROG Strix B760-I Gaming WiFi, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BR8TVLPL/- Working as described, nice looking MB. Thank you, ASUS - now ROG motherboards have the Memtest86+ built in BIOS. This very helpful feature allows PC builders to check memory before operating system installation and prevent blue screens and failures during OS install and system use in case of defective memory.In my case originally ordered CORSAIR DOMINATOR PLATINUM RGB DDR5 RAM 64GB (2x32GB) 6400MHz (Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0C1R95SPW/) was defective. Both memory modules came to life and showed ok in BIOS but Memtest86+ got errors. I did test modules one by one in the same memory slot and found out that one of the modules is the cause of the failures. Returned the defective memory and bought another from a different brand (Item #6). ASUS ROG Motherboard chosen for the look. In my opinion the best Intel (or may be overall) mini ITX MB on the market is MSI MPG Z790I Edge WiFi Gaming Motherboard (Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BHCJ6KQ2/ ) I own one and have a very best experience.--Item 6) Memory: TEAMGROUP T-Force Delta RGB DDR5 Ram 64GB (2x32GB) 6000MHz, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BNTV1945/-Very good product, works as described, nice looking, recognized by Aura Sync.--Item 7) Graphics Card: MSI Gaming GeForce RTX 4060 Ti 16GB, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CCFZMHSM/- Graphics card work as supposed to, have low power consumption. This GPU was chosen for the look only. Anyway, the presented system can play all modern games well at 1440p. But if you want the very good gaming experience, I will recommend at least RTX 4070 Ti like MSI Gaming GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Ventus 2X 12G OC. And the very best (talking about built on Hydra Italy Mini Case) will be the system with 850W PCIe 5.0 SFX PSU and:a)  MSI MPG Z790I Edge WiFi Gaming Motherboard, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BHCJ6KQ2/b) Intel Core i9-13900KF,  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BCFM3CJ4/c) ASUS ProArt GeForce RTX™ 4080 16GB OC, ( Amazon https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C75J66C8/).

Mounting for regular size 120mm fan included. Easy installation - just install radiator 1st and mount fan after. ID-COOLING IS-67-XT chosen because of black color. In my opinion DeepCool AN600 Low Profile CPU Cooler (Amazon https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C4P8ZPWT/) has a little bit better cooling performance (I have one in a very compact Flex ATX build).--Item 11) EZDIY-FAB Moonlight 120mm RGB PWM Case Fan, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07X8T79QY/Good, quiet and nice-looking fan. Actually, it is a leftover piece from a 9 fans ATX tower system build. If you want to build a similar system with a similar look, I recommend Cooler Master MF120 Halo² Fan Duo-Ring ARGB (Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BWKZGYXJ/). This fan has a similar look but has better airflow / air pressure.---Item 12) 24 Pin RGB Cable Extension Kit (used ARGB strip only), Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07WN4G7KC/- The power cable connector to MB too tight - did not go all the way down, afraid to broke the MB if try to apply more force (the regular PSU cable fits perfect). Connector to PSU too tight as well, but was able to connect all the way down. Actually, in reality the system with this cable does not look good (too much RGB). Did use ARGB strip only for decoration purposes on the GPU side.--Item 13) Thermal Paste: ARCTIC MX-6. Optional - I have a very good experience using this thermal paste brand and always using it for the builds (so thermal paste provided by ID-COOLING was not used). Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09VDLH5M6/-----------Overall, I assume the goal is reached - the presented system can play recent games and look very cool (in my humble opinion).",Intel-core-i7-13000

United States,16-05-2024,The quality you expect from Intel,"Purchased on sale for $334. The 13700k is the best value CPU if you require enough speed for high-end gaming + productivity (e.g. video editing/rendering, streaming, multitasking, etc). This thing is fast. I was able to undervolt it and overlock it to 5.5 Ghz (all p-core) and 4.4 Ghz (all e-cores). I could go higher if I wanted to spend more time on it, but this was a quick overclock. Perfectly stable and runs (relatively)cool with the undervolt.

It's a great CPU and is handling everything I throw at it.  Stays cool even without a fancy AIO / liquid cooling setup.  During the process of installing the CPU on the socket, it fell into place perfectly, but when adjusting the motherboard arm to secure the CPU into the socket, it did feel I had to put a bit more force than I would have thought necessary, but it clicked into place and is running smoothly with no issues.

United States,26-11-2023,Fast! Worth the price,"The Intel Core i7-13700KF presents a compelling value proposition for its price. As part of Intel's 13th Gen ""Raptor Lake"" series, it boasts a robust 8 Performance-core (P-core) and 8 Efficient-core (E-core) configuration, mirroring the previous-gen flagship i9-12900K but at a more accessible price point​​. This configuration, coupled with updates like larger L2 caches for P-cores and improved cache hardware-prefetchers, contributes to its outstanding performance.In terms of raw performance, the i7-13700KF demonstrates commendable prowess. It outperforms the 12th gen flagship Core i9-12900K in single and multi-core tests, albeit marginally, and shows significant performance gains over its direct predecessor, the Core i7-12700K, with a 12% and 32.5% lead in single-core and multi-core tests, respectively​​. When compared to competitors like the AMD Ryzen 7 5800X and Ryzen 9 5950X, the i7-13700KF shows a remarkable 23% and 25% single-core performance bump, and an even more impressive 67% and 15% lead in multi-core performance against these AMD chips​​.However, buyers should be aware that the Core i7-13700KF does not come with integrated graphics. For users who require onboard video capabilities, the slightly higher-priced Core i7-13700K would be the best choice. The absence of integrated graphics in the 13700KF model can be a significant consideration for those who don't plan to use a dedicated graphics card.The i7-13700KF stands out as an excellent choice for its price, offering high-end performance that rivals even some flagship models from the previous generation. Its value is particularly notable when considering its performance metrics against direct competitors and predecessors",Intel-core-i7-13000

Out of the box this CPU will comfortably run at 5.4ghz, it performs amazing under load and in my system stays perfectly cool.This year-old CPU, blows away brand new CPU’s from the likes of Apple and AMD, I truly cannot recommend the 13th gen lineup enough, this being the centerpiece of it all.If you do get an LGA 1700 CPU, go ahead and get the bracket upgrade for your MOBO, it’ll save you time down the long run and helps to keep temps in check.",Intel-core-i7-13000

There are some drawbacks though.I mean at full load this thing draws like 280w, but that’s a rare situation if you’re just gaming. Generally my temps sit at 50-70C with a 280mm radiator, but I rarely go above 120w gaming. Compared to AMD, Intel just eats power.

United States,26-12-2023,Outstanding performance and utilities!,"The highest package temps my CPU gets while running multiple applications is 85 degrees Celsius. And that's only for brief moments. Average 68 - 75 degrees while gaming with high graphics games with youtube running in the background. Maxes at the 253 rated watts for me, which really is fine. Average of about 100 watts and computer overall idles @ 65 watts, which is 25 watts less than my old i7 4th gen. No need to undervolt this CPU, even though you can, you'll just be giving yourself future headaches if you do. During the Cinebench stress test you get temps that max out at 98 - 100 degrees Celsius, but remember that's absolute max mode, 99% of users will never use this CPU for more than several minutes at. If Intel's Extreme Tuning Utility does not automatically download when installing, definitely get it from intels website and learn to use it. It is easy to use, and you won't regret it. I just use it for monitoring performance, but you can use it for easy optimize and under/overvolt with too, but I'd recommend doing any of that through your motherboard BIOS if you decide to. Most new BIOS's are easier and safer for that kind of stuff anyway. Do your research on which to use and how.

For the most part, assembly was very easy. I do video editing, audio editing, streaming, wordprocessing, browsing and email with my setup. I use all of my SATA ports and even have a plug-in eSATA card for more ports. So most of my drive bays are filled. The cpu, dram and everything I have connected to my power supply and motherboard has been rock solid stable, and the case holds in all together. It just works exactly the way I want and have no anomalies. The power supply, motherboard and all components run cool in the case with an i7-13700K CPU, 128 GB of Crucial DDR5-4800 that is clocked at 5200 automatically set by the motherboard itself. My video card is a the very modest ASUS GeForce GT 1030 2GB GDDR5 HDMI DVI Graphics Card (GT1030-2G-CSM) because I transitioned my ancient setup from MBR to GPT and needed to be able to boot the old system in the new motherboard before updating the Windows 10 Pro config to GPT UEFI and still be able to boot legacy devices. Everything just worked like a Swiss Chronograph. I strongly recommend this cpu, dram, the power supply, the case, the ASUS ProArt Z790-Creator WiFi 6E LGA 1700, the Asus video card, and am also recommending the Crucial MX500 SATA drives I use.

Everything opens almost instantly, whether it be Windows 11's File Explorer, Edge browser and webpages, and opening files in general.  I upgraded primarily because I am a developer, and Visual Studio + Dotfuscator would take almost 8 minutes to compile and obfuscate my largest program on my old build.

United States,01-02-2023,Who needs an i9! This thing is amazing!,"I built a new computer during the height of covid (Dummy, I know, right?) and decided on a i9-9900k. I'm a sysadmin by trade, so remoting in and fixing servers has never been an issue with that processor..but for gaming..Titles like Cyberpunk, Days Gone, to even WoW..there were areas that my 3080 was being bottlenecked by the 9900k.I coupled this CPU with a MSI EDGE z790 DDR4 (I have fantastic Samsung B-Die CL14 3600 DDR4 from the previous build). So far, in Cyberpunk I'm seeing 25-30 more FPS on 1440p Ultra settings w/ Raytraycing on High. WoW is getting 50+ more FPS, and I'm getting over 100 FPS in Valdrakken, where I was getting 45-50 FPS with the 9900k with the same settings as cyberpunk (1440p ultra (10 graphics settings).I'm using the Corsair iCUE H100i Elite LCD 240mm AIO, with Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut Extreme thermal paste to cool this bad boy, and even at prolonged sessions in Cyberpunk, my temps are not getting above 65c. And no, I have not done the Contact Plate mod.TL;DR - This CPU is blazing fast, and if your current processor is a few years old it may very well be worth the upgrade.

I was required to flash because older boards cannot support the new CPU yet. I suggest people who used a 12th gen chipset and were looking to upgrade follow their respective motherboard’s vendor manual. The installation was incredibly easy, and I booted the BIOS after the BIOS update without any problem. I had hit 5 GHz on the CPU without overclocking. It also supported 6000 MHz DDR5 RAM without any issues after enabling XMP. The reasonable pricing for Z690 or Z790 boards makes the i7-13700K a good combo compared to AMD’s expensive Ryzen 7000 CPUs and motherboard costs. For people who are still on older generations, the vast E cores and P cores offered by Intel’s 13th gen make it worth it to accomplish CPU-intensive tasks like Handbrake or Adobe Premiere. This CPU runs cool with a 360 mm AIO and a high airflow case (around 30-36 C idle temperature for me).

United States,21-06-2023,Fast but runs very hot,"Concerning Intel Core i9-13900KF,I have this CPU with board ASUS ROG Strix Z790-E Gaming WiFi 6E LGA 1700 for gaming usage.  Once I discovered that I had to slow the memory down from the 6600MHz XMP rating to 6200MHz, the board/cpu combo has worked very reliably  (multiple passes of OCCT Gold stress test).  Just checking the XMP II box,  the 6200MHz box and the (so called) AI overclocking box in the bios gives a score of 40K on Cinebench R23 so it's plenty fast -- the loss of 400MHz memory bandwidth isn't a big deal.  I tried various other adjustments but the latter turned out to be sufficiently fast and very reliable.  My current chip has a Silicon Predictor(SP) of 99 (roll of the dice).  I suspect that higher SP levels while possible are rare.I am using a ARCTIC Liquid Freezer II 360  AIO which works OK but the CPU can run hot.  The mother board cooling prediction for said AIO is 155 but that is not really enough for this chip to run all out.  It is easy to get this CPU up to 100C using OCT Power Stress test.  While the CPU might run at 100C for a long time, it will not do it any good and it will not run reliably -- I needed to check the 90C max box in the bios to get it to pass the OCCT power stress test.  I have a RTX 4090 and in the OCCT power test the net system power gets up to 1100W.  Normal gaming so far never gets to such power levels but still worth considering.FWIW, I have had a CPU apparently fail from running the OCCT Power Stress test.  If you want to run this CPU all out with reasonable temps, you really need significant cooling.  I doubt any AIO will work for this.  I suggest an open loop system with something like a Watercool MO-RA3 420 PRO radiator.All said, If you are building a gaming system, you would be just as well served with a ASUS ROG Strix Z690-E and a i9-12900KF CPU.

United States,29-05-2023,"Excellent, beware it does not come with a FAN","Excellent processor. It is a beast in gaming and in productivity, for the price I believe is unrivaled. Beware that you should separately buy a CPU Cooler because it does not come with one.Also beware that most Motherboards nowadays put no restraints to this processor in the BIOS, so they let it draw unlimited power and with that comes a very hot temperature limit. For example I'm using an 360mm AIO cooler and with the stock motherboard settings of my AORUS ELITE AX when running cinebench it reaches 100°C within 12 seconds of starting. Of course this temperature is only seen in stress tests and never during games (there, the max I've seen the CPU get is 67°C) but is something to be aware of.All in all happy with this beast",Intel-core-i9-13000

Probably Not for you Though,"If it have the money to spare and want a processor that'll last you at least 5 years (and are a power user like I am) its a good choice. But most people say the advantages over the 13700k aren't worth it to most users.If you're just using the PC as a high-end gaming rig an i7-13700k is more than enough even with a 4090 GPU. This processor is designed to benefit more advanced users so I'd save the 150$ and get the cheaper 13700k. Also this processor is notoriously hot, so a beefy noctua air cooler or preferably a 280mm+ watercooler AIO is necessary (especially for overclocking).",Intel-core-i9-13000

Or just for gaming and office use this CPU beats everything else to date.  Buy one now and if you have an i9-12900K or KF sell it. Pay attention to the necessary new BIOS install. Not one crash to date but occasional throttling down when stressed as CPU temperature gets too high occurs now and again but not very often and sure stronger Air Fan or water cool fix that if it bothers you.

United States,18-02-2023,Very powerful CPU,"I have upgraded the 12700 in the following computerMotherboard: Gigabyte Z690 UD AX DDDR4RAM: Crucial 32GB DDR4 CL15GPU: AMD RX-6800XTCooler: Scythe MugenAnd, I have used Gigabyte's Instant 6 GHZ feature which was applying 100 mV more than what was needed for the processor, exceeding 1.45 Vcore. So I undervolted by 100mV as well after overclocking to keep the CPU safer at a lower voltage which required spending several hours to find to optimal settings. Then, I limited the power to 230W which reduced the temperature to below 90C for all types of loads.Single thread CPU-Z went from 770 to 970, up 26%Multi thread CPU-Z went from 8970 to 12690, up 41%Single thread Cinebench R23 went from 1810 to 2334Multi thread Cinebench R23 went from 21931 to 30925 (max)In summary, 13700KF has been a significant upgrade even from the previous 12th generation. My photo editing and Linux kernel compile tasks are significantly (and noticeably) faster.  It would be an even more significant upgrade from the earlier generations. However, if all you care is game performance Cyberpunk 2077 frame rate at 4K-Ultra settings did not change with the CPU upgrade (12700 to 13700K) since the frame rate is limited by the GPU which is AMD RX 6800XT.

Just a heads up to anyone who plans to pair 13900k with 4090, don’t be a smartass and try to put it in small case, you will regret it later. I personally recommend big case with high airflow like fractal design torrent mid size atx but if you don’t want to spend too much money on graphics card and happy with getting something like 4060 then you can get the nano version of fractal torrent.

United States,24-02-2023,Over clock at your risk,"I bought two of these from Amazon after one from another vendor failed to POST.  Both worked the first time.  Do you need 24 cores for games?  Most games use 4 or 6 cores max, so probably not.  Video editing can benefit from the extra cores.  Intel supports XMP (extreme memory profile) and this processor is unlocked (it can be overclocked).  Overclocking increases the power consumption and heat; therefore, one needs a robust cooling solution.  Overclocking can void your warranty which is strange since Intel allows and even promotes overclocking with the Intel Extreme Tuning Utility.  I have the NZXT Kraken x 73 RGB liquid cooler.  With the NZXT CAM software you can see the CPU (and GPU) temperatures and control the fan speeds, reducing the risk of damaging the processor.  While idling (at 5.5 GHz) the CPU temperature is 30 C.  Under a 50% load or overclocked the temperatures are below 60 C.  Pros: Good for video editing Cons: A bit pricey for a gaming computer.  Don't overclock without monitoring temperatures to keep below 60 C.",Intel-core-i9-13000

United States,17-11-2022,"Intel, cant go wrong",bought this with a z790 to replace my older 10900K Intel so I could start using PCIEx5. Currency running Amazons New World with a RTX3900 Liquid cooled. New World is hard on the CPU when running 4K and my utilization went from 55 percent to 25/ I bought a coolmaster 480mm liquid cool fan system for it and it runs nice and cool.,Intel-core-i9-13000
Canada,09-08-2023,Fastest Intel Processor for the Buck,"This is the cream of the crop if you going for Intel CPU's. High Clocks, good IPC and stability. There's no secrets on Intel processors it is just plug and play, on AMD side you have to worry about other factors like memory compatibility.It could be cheaper. I think $500 is somewhat steep, but this is the present reality so we have to endure and hope it gets better in the future.",Intel-core-i7-13000

United States,22-08-2023,COOLERS BEWARE,This CPU runs HOT. Im upgrading from an i7-9700k and this beast is definitely more difficult to cool. Saving up for a new cooler and fans but I have to undervolt in the meanwhile. Great product though very strong and fast!,Intel-core-i7-13000
United States,27-05-2023,OVERCLOCKED,Overclocked this to 5.6GHZ / 4.5 GHZ E-Core -- Cinebench 10 minute run- 87C --- DID NOT TOUCH ANY VOLTAGES or AI OC From ASUS -- all stock CPU -- just use AI SUITE 3 and set it and apply ( IF YOU HAVE ASUS Z690)Stableon over 15 tested games / and tons of CPU Burn in benchmarks,Intel-core-i7-13000
United States,18-02-2023,Great performance for the price,my only gripe is that it DEFINITELY NEEDED TO BE PACKAGED BETTER!!! Other than that I'm getting exactly the level of stellar performance I'd expect out of intel. The processors box was put in a larger box with no bubble wrap causing the plastic clamshell holding the processor to come free from the box provided by intel thankfully there wasn't any damage but it is definitely something to consider. 5 star rating is for the product not whoever packaged it!,Intel-core-i7-13000
United States,01-10-2023,Procesador.,Gran procesador y una gran diferencia con los core i5.,Intel-core-i7-13000
United States,06-11-2022,Runs Hotter than my 12700K,Took two weeks to get one first 13700K I ordered Fed Ex lost it..... Sure they did....Got a refund through Amazon so I bought the 13700KF instead saved 30.00. Ran a few benchmarks and Games. I'm using a Noctua Fan cooler NH-U12A. CPUID said the CPU did get up to 89c under package load.So it's possible to fan cool this thing my last CPU was a 12700K just dropped this in my Z690 Asus Tuf. It does run faster than the 12700K but it's marginal in benchmarks but I'm still using DDR4 and my 3070 RTX.,Intel-core-i7-13000
United States,01-08-2023,Works like it should,I don't really go in for testing myself. All I know is it works perfectly from the first start up and continues to do so. No lag and no problems so far.,Intel-core-i7-13000

Had to switch to an AIO liquid cooling solution to make sure I disperse all that heat properly too my room. In the summer I'm thinking I'll be able to double my room as a sauna.An amazing value 5/5,I guess it also runs games and opens visual studio quick.",Intel-core-i7-13000
United States,17-12-2022,"Decent priced. New, Fast and Hot!","The i7 13700KF arrived on time and undamaged and cheaper here than many other places.  Much better upgrade from the i7 9700KF although, the 9700 is still a great processor. 13th Gen i7 is very fast and power hungry, you should also have atleast a 260mm aio and good air flow. It's hard to load this processor up with tasks it just shreds. No issues so far.",Intel-core-i7-13000

United States,01-03-2023,"She hot, but she fast!","Great for streaming and multimedia! this chip does run hot, so ensure you have a proper cooling solution. If you are using this under full load for extended time periods Id recommend a large AIO or custom loop..",Intel-core-i9-13000
United States,22-11-2022,The best of the best.,This thing shreds in gaming. It has no equal. And smooooooooth frametime graphs when compared to my 5800X3D. Noticeably less stuttering and hitching in Unreal Engine 4 and Unity games. Watch the Der Bauer video about 13900K efficiency. He power limits the 13900K to match the 7950X in ECO mode and the 13900K is better performance per watt.,Intel-core-i9-13000

You basically have to have a custom loop in order to properly overclock this thing, unless you want to use restrictive power limits which reduce performance. Thankfully, 5.5/4.3 GHz is already overkill in terms of single and multi-core performance, and beats everything else out there.",Intel-core-i9-13000

United States,06-08-2023,It's a beast (epic fps in PUBG)!,"Bought this mostly for bringing up my frame rate in PUBG (I should note I also bought new RAM with this, but kept my old GTX 3070). My frame rate went from ~100 fps to >350 fps at 1080p, far exceeding the 140 refresh rate of my monitor. Hence, after 5 years of owning this monitor I upgraded my PUBG game settings from 1080p to 1440p and still get about 250 fps.I should also note that this was the first Intel system I bought since the early 2000s (I've been an AMD fan boy and vividly remember getting an AMD Athlon, Athlon 2, multiple generations of Ryzen over the years). That said, now that I'm older, I recognize the importance of having a strong domestic (US/Western) industrial base for high-end semiconductors.Because Intel builds its CPUs its own US-based fabs (as opposed to AMD, which relies on TSMC, which may be subject to future political instability) paired with the epic performance in games, I decided to go back to team blue and couldn't be happier.",Intel-core-i7-13000
United States,15-12-2022,Very fast,Easy installation in my Z790 Asus board. I set it up in the bios to perform its best rather than have it run its coldest. My Arctic 360mm radiator takes care of the heat. It absolutely blows away handling any game I throw at it. The most I've seen it run was around 25% with Crysis Remastered 2 and Cyberpunk 2077. Temps during high demand games go around the high 50s. Keep in mind my case has ridiculous cooling from over 20 fans + 360mm CPU/GPU radiators.,Intel-core-i7-13000
